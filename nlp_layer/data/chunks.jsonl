IYP also had a verypractical aim: to promote the developmentof sustainable potato-based systems thatenhance the well-being of potato producersand consumers, especially in developingcountries. This technical guide is a contribution to achievement of the International Year’sbroader development objective. Today, potatoproduction and consumption is boomingworldwide, with ever greater quantities beingprocessed for the convenience food andsnack industries, while its importance as asubsistence crop continues to expand. Manydeveloping countries wish to enter lucrativeemerging markets for potatoes and potatoproducts, but to do so need to make majorimprovements in the productivity,profitability and sustainability of theirpotato subsectors. For example, potato yieldsin the developing world average around 10to 15 tonnes per hectare, less than half ofaverage yields achieved by farmers inWestern Europe and North America. The present guide builds on experience gained through partnerships forged duringIYP implementation to address criticalaspects of sustainable potato production. Itrepresents the first inter-partner effort, post-2008, aimed at producing technicalguidelines that can be used by decisionmakers in developing countries to improvethe sustainability of potato production andboost the potato subsector’s contribution to social and economic development. The guide presents a summary review of factors that constrain the potato subsector intropical and subtropical countries, principlesof Good Agriculture Practices, and GAPsrelevant to potato production. It providesindicators and recommendations for actionin key areas – from the conservation andutilization of potato biodiversity andimprovements in seed systems, tomanagement of soil fertility, insect pest anddiseases, water use, the importance ofstorage, and the opportunities created byvalue addition. It also provides “snapshots”of selected best practices and examples ofsuccessful approaches in developingcountries. It concludes with a series of usefulfact sheets on key issues in potatodevelopment. While aimed primarily at decision makers at institutional level, the guide willalso be of use to technicians, potato growersand processors. We trust that it will helpfurther IYP’s goal of helping to realize thepotato’s full potential as a “food of thefuture”. 5 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTIONForeword Shivaji Pandey Director, Plant Production andProtection Division Food and Agriculture Organization of the United NationsPamela Anderson Director GeneralInternational PotatoCenter Abbreviations and acronyms CIP International Potato Center DLS Diffuse light storesFAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United NationsGAP Good Agricultural PracticesFFS Farmers’ Field SchoolsICM Integrated Crop ManagementIDM Integrated Disease ManagementIPM Integrated Pest ManagementIPPM Integrated Potato Pest ManagementNGO Non-Governmental OrganizationsNSI Nutrient Supplementation IndexPMCA Participatory Market Chain ApproachPRSP Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers Development of this guide was initiated as part of the InternationalYear of the Potato 2008, which wasfacilitated by FAO’s Plant Production and Protection Division (AGP), inpartnership with the International PotatoCenter (CIP).", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

(PHOTO: MOSTAFA MOFTAH) The potato is the world’s most important root and tuber cropworldwide. It is grown in more than125 countries and consumed almost daily by more than a billion people.Hundreds of millions of people indeveloping countries depend on potatoes fortheir survival. Potato cultivation isexpanding strongly in the developing world,where the potato’s ease of cultivation andnutritive content have made it a valuablefood security and cash crop for millions offarmers. Developing countries are now theworld’s biggest producers – and importers –of potatoes and potato products. Once harvested, potatoes can be used for a variety of purposes: as a fresh vegetable forcooking at home, as raw material forprocessing into food products, foodingredients, starch and alcohol, as feed foranimals, and as seed tubers for growing thenext season’s crop. Around the world, consumer demand is shifting from fresh tubers to processedproducts and ever greater quantities ofpotatoes are being processed to meet risingdemand for convenience food and snacks.The major drivers behind this trend includeexpanding urban populations, risingincomes, diversification of diets, andlifestyles that leave less time for preparingthe fresh product for consumption. The development of a vibrant, profitable and sustainable potato subsector indeveloping countries depends on measuresto overcome a number of persistentconstraints. Those measures includeimprovements in the quality of planting material, potato varieties that have reducedwater needs, greater resistance to insect pests and diseases, and resilience in the face of climate changes, and farming systems thatmake more sustainable use of naturalresources. Not least, potato development –and agricultural development in general –requires empowerment of small farmersthrough improved access to productioninputs, credit and markets. These guidelines present a compilation of potato management practices in use intropical and subtropical developingcountries that have helped increase potatoproduction and productivity. They can berefined to address particular conditions inspecific locations. The publication providesindicators of sustainability, and highlightspotential areas of improvement for potatodevelopment. While aimed primarily atdecision makers, the manual tries as muchas possible to use language familiar tofarmers. 9 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTIONIntroduction POTATO FIELDS IN CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA.

To realize the fullpotential of this crop, developingcountries must address both supply-and demand-side constraints. POTATO MARKET IN KASUNGU, MALAWI. (PHOTO: ANNE LI) The potato’s biological characteristics Many constraints derive from the biological characteristics of the potato itself. Theseinclude the low multiplication rates of seedtubers, and the technical difficulties andcosts associated with maintaining seedquality through successive multiplications,owing to the potato’s susceptibility to soiland seed-borne insect pests and diseases.Seed tubers are also bulky: two to threetonnes per hectare is the typical seedrequirement. Stringent phytosanitaryrestrictions limit the movement of potatogermplasm, seed tubers and fresh warepotatoes. Potatoes have high fertilizerrequirements but low utilization efficiency.Post-harvest, fresh potato tubers deterioratequickly in tropical and subtropicalenvironments, especially in the lowlands. Lack of efficient seed systems Many developing countries lack efficientsystems for the regular multiplication anddistribution of certified seed tubers and therapid deployment of new, improved varieties.Causal factors include the limited technicalcapacity of human resources, lack ofmanagerial expertise and inadequateresource allocations to seed systems and thepotato subsector in general. As a result,farmer-based seed systems are still common,and have managed to supply plantingmaterial of limited quality over the years,and contributed to expanding cultivation ofthe crop. Farmer seed systems face manychallenges, but also offer an opportunity toimprove seed supply, provided suitable training is available and links with theformal sector are established. Diseases and insect pests Diseases and insect pests are another majorconstraint. New strains of late blight havereached many developing countries andcontinue to spread. Late blight constitutesthe most serious threat to increased potatoproduction. Second to late blight inimportance, particularly in warmer, moretropical regions, is bacterial wilt. The impactof insect pests varies between regions. Majorinsect pests include aphids, tuber moths, leafminers, Colorado potato beetle and Andeanpotato weevil. 13 FACTORS CONSTRAININGTHE POTATOSUBSECTOR Technical factors 14 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTIONThe US government’s African Growth and Opportunity Act(AGOA) provides preferentialaccess for more than 1,800 tarifflines, including agricultural commodities, from designatedsub-Saharan African countries.The Everything But Arms (EBA)initiative of the European Union (EU) eliminates import tariffsand restrictions on numerousgoods, including agriculturalproducts, from least developedcountries provided that planthealth regulations are met. EBAgrants duty-free access forimports from most LessDeveloped Countries, except fora few sensitive commodities(e.g. bananas, sugar and rice)that will be liberalized gradually.Most of the commoditiesincluded in EBA previouslyreceived duty-free access to theEU under preferentialprogrammes such as theLomé/Cotonou Agreement. Export markets open in USA and Europe LOCAL TRANSPORTATION OF POTATOES TO MARKETIN MYANMAR.(PHOTO: ZIN MIN) High production costs and lack of credit Compared to other food crops, production of potatoes is capital-intensive, requiring thepurchase of large quantities of bulky seedand the application of high-cost inputs suchas fertilizers and pesticides. With limitedaccess to credit and few means of mitigatingthe risks of taking out loans, small-scalefarmers find it difficult to compete in potatoproduction. The current global financialcrisis could leave a great number of farmerswith little money and no credit to invest inproduction. Price instability With potato becoming increasingly a cashcrop, small-scale potato growers arevulnerable to abrupt changes in input andoutput prices.

Inefficiency of local markets Potato prices are usually determined bysupply and demand, not the vagaries ofinternational markets as in the case ofcereals. It is, therefore, a crop that can helplow-income farmers and consumers to rideout episodes of food price inflation, such asthat experienced worldwide in 2007-08.However, the profitability of potato dependson efficient local markets and measures tocontrol overproduction.Limited access to higher value markets To be successful, small-scale potato growers need access to profitable emerging domesticmarkets – such as the rapidly growingprocessing segment – as well as to potatoexport markets. However, access to domesticmarkets is often restricted by the marketingpower of foreign suppliers, while exports areconstrained by trade barriers in developedcountries to processed products from thedeveloping world. However, there areencouraging “success stories” that illustratehow small-scale producers can increaseproduction and expand their market share.In India, potato growers who adapted newtechnology with the support of McCainFoods Ltd more than doubled their yieldsand incomes. Other private industries,including small businesses, have launchedpotato chips made from coloured nativepotatoes that were prototyped by CIP inorder to promote the sustainable use ofbiodiversity in the Andean Region. Recentlegislation in the USA and Europe providegreater access to agricultural products fromthe developing world. 15 FACTORS CONSTRAININGTHE POTATOSUBSECTOR Socio-economic factors 16 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTION Neglect of the potato subsector With a few notable exceptions – such as Ethiopia – most developing countries havepolicies toward the potato subsector, andespecially small-scale producers, that can bebest characterized as “benign neglect”. Littleor no public investment is targeted atintegrated strategies for crop improvement,value addition and marketing schemes orthe potato production-processing-marketingchain. Many countries lack adequate seedproduction systems backed by certificationand seed laws. Breeding rights are often notrespected, reducing incentives to breeders tocreate new adapted and resistant varieties. Inmany areas, poor infrastructural facilitiesand poor access to markets are also majorchallenges to expansion of potato productionand its profitability. Inadequate capacity building initiatives The potato has attracted private sector investment in the crucial area of seedmultiplication and seed systems in only afew countries. Support for programmes forthe diffusion of new varieties and for thescaling up of existing integrated disease andinsect pest management technologies andmethodologies is generally inadequate.Programmes to upgrade the skills of potatogrowers need to be matched by governmentefforts to create, monitor and enforceregulations on pesticide use and the spreadof pesticide or fertilizer residues into watersupplies, which are major constraints to thesustainability of potato production systems.Lack of support to farmer organizationsand entrepreneurs Support for potato farmer groups and associations and for local entrepreneurshipis lacking in many countries. In Bangladeshand Pakistan, powerful lobbies represent themost serious obstacle to the development ofa local seed potato industry. One notableexception is Argentina, where efforts arebeing made by public and private sector toimprove seed quality and promote varietydevelopment, and to transfer technology forintegrated crop management to its contractgrowers. 17 FACTORS CONSTRAININGTHE POTATOSUBSECTOR Policy and institutional factors POTATO PLOTS IN SRI LANKA.

The cost of private GAPstandard certification (e.g. forGlobalGAP or Tesco Nature’sChoice) may be higher owing tostricter requirements. However,this does not necessarily have tobe the case with adoption ofgood practices per se. Generally,there is no higher cost to theconsumer – that is why retailersand commercial farming arerapidly adopting GAPs. Whereadoption of GAPs entailsadditional costs, the benefits ineconomic, social orenvironmental terms are usuallyhigher.The cost of GAPs SORTING OF POTATO IN INDIA. (PHOTO: RINI MAJUMDAR) GAPs may be applied to a wide range of farming systems and at differentscales. They are applied throughsustainable agricultural methods, such as integrated pest management,integrated water and fertilizer management,and conservation agriculture. GAPs arebased on four principles:1. to economically and efficiently produce sufficient quantities of safe andnutritious food; 2. to sustain and enhance ;3. to maintain viable farming enterprises and contribute to livelihoods; 4. to meet the cultural and social needs of society. GAP applications are being developed by governments, NGOs and the private sector tomeet the needs of growers and processorsand for other specific purposes. They providethe opportunity to assess and decide onwhich to follow at each step of theproduction process. It is important that GAPs are applied in a coordinated way. For each agriculturalproduction system, GAPs should be part ofa comprehensive management strategy,providing for adjustments when needed inresponse to changing conditions. Theimplementation of such a managementstrategy requires knowledge, planning,measuring, monitoring and record-keepingat each step of the production process.Adoption of GAPs may sometimes result inhigher production, processing andmarketing costs, and higher prices for theconsumer. To minimize costs, while maintaining the quality and safety of foodproducts, participatory technical trainingand advice can be used to inform farmers ofnew technologies that will benefit them. Information on options for GAP adoption would be facilitated through the use ofcommon databases and informationexchange platforms on available enablingtechnologies and integrated productiontechniques for different major agro-ecological areas. 21 GOOD AGRICULTURALPRATICESAND POTATOPRODUCTIONGAP concepts and principles 22 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTIONSoil management 6Reduce wind and water erosion through hedging and ditching. 6Apply fertilizers at appropriate moments in adequate doses (e.g. based on soil analysis andcrop requirement) to avoid extra costs andpossible run-off and leaching. 6Maintain or restore soil organic content through application of manure, use of grazingand/or crop rotation . 6Reduce soil compaction by avoiding use of heavy machinery. 6Maintain soil structure by limiting heavy and sometimes unnecessary tillage practices, andthrough use of cover crops such as pulses.Water use efficiency 6Use minimum or zero-tillage and maintain soil cover to reduce soil evaporation and improvesoil structure and water infiltration. 6To avoid water loss by drainage, schedule irrigation and monitor plant needs and soilwater reserve status. 6Prevent soil salinization by matching water input to needs, allowing some drainage andrecycling water whenever possible. 6Avoid excessive drainage and fertilizer run-off. 6Maintain permanent soil cover", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

(PHOTO: MANUEL SEOANE SALAZAR) In potato-based systems in developing countries, the GAP concept can beassociated with critical productiondecision factors and recommendations. Environment and production zones The potato is essentially a “cool weather crop”, with temperature being the mainlimiting factor. In tropical areas, potatoshould be grown where the climate istempered by altitude (1 500 – 4 200 m) orat lower altitudes provided the crop is grownduring the cool season. The ideal condition for tuberization is a night temperature of around 16°C, whileoptimum yields are obtained where meandaily temperatures are in the 18-20°C range.Loose, moist and well-drained slightly acidsoil (with pH of 5.0-5.5) or volcanic uplandsoils are preferred. The water supply for thepotato crop should be regular, especiallyfrom the stage of tuber initiation until theend of tuber enlargement. Cultivation methods A successful potato crop depends onjudicious cultural practices. These includegood knowledge of variety purity andcharacteristics such as dormancy duration,the physiological condition of seed potatotubers (well sprouted and 30-80 g in weight,depending on variety) and resistance to themain transmissible potato diseases andnematodes. Potatoes are best grown in rotation. In the Andes, it is usually the first crop in therotation.

Sometimes naturalfallow is necessary to prevent soilimpoverishment and the build-up of potato-specific diseases and insect pests. Soil preparation for the potato crop should be adequate with minimum soildisturbance. Naturally loose soils, andloamy and sandy loam soils that are rich inorganic matter with good drainage andaeration, are the most suitable. Planting depth, density and spacing depend on the variety chosen and tuber size,and should allow for shallow inter-rowridging, when required. Usually, about twotonnes of seed tubers are planted perhectare. To give the crop a competitive advantage, weeding should be performed after full cropemergence (about 4 weeks after planting)and after the plants have reached a height ofabout 20 cm. Shallow ridging is donesubsequently to prevent the stolonsbecoming aerials, and to protect tubersagainst insect pests, disease infection andgreening. Crop rotation and carefulchemical control with herbicides, applied atminimum lethal doses, may be part of anintegrated weed management system,although in most developing countries weedmanagement is usually carried outmanually. A few basic precautions against insect pests and diseases can help avoid great yield 25 GOOD AGRICULTURALPRATICESAND POTATOPRODUCTIONProduction decision factors 26 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTION POTATO HARVESTING IN PANUTY DISTRICT,NEPAL.(PHOTO: G.M.

They include crop rotation, use of resistant varieties andhealthy, certified seed tubers (if available orat least seed from a reputed source orthrough positive selection), and integrateddisease and insect pest management, whichinvolves regular monitoring of aphid andthrips vectors, other insects and naturalenemy populations, and chemical sprayingonly when necessary. Fertilizer application during the stages of pre-planting, planting or crop growthshould be determined by soil nutrientavailability, taking into account thepotato’s high demand for potassium,phosphorus and magnesium deficienciesin acid soils. The NPK ratio 1-1-1 is usuallya wise choice to avoid spoiling tuberquality. The potato can benefit from theapplication of organic manure at the startof a new rotation as it provides a goodnutrient balance and protects soil structurefrom compaction and erosion. As soil moisture must be maintained at a relatively high level in production ofpotatoes, compared to other crops, irrigationmay be required where rainfall is limited.Harvesting For most commercial varieties, yellowing ofthe potato plant’s leaves and easy separationof tubers from stolons indicate that thepotato crop has reached maturity. If thepotatoes are to be stored rather thanconsumed immediately, they are left in thesoil to allow their skin to harden – hard skinalso help seed potatoes to resist storagediseases. However, leaving tubers for toolong in the ground increases their exposureto the fungal disease black scurf andincreases the risk of losing quality andmarketable yield. To facilitate harvesting and stop tuber growth, potato vines should be removed twoweeks before the potatoes are dug up.Depending on the scale of the production,potatoes are harvested using a spading fork,a plough or commercial potato harvestersthat unearth the plant and shake or blowthe soil from the tubers. During harvesting,especially if it is done mechanically, it isimportant to avoid bruising or otherinjuries, which provide entry points forstorage diseases and reduce the commercial,processing quality and storability of thetubers.

In regionswith only one cropping season per year andwhere storage of tubers from one season tothe next is difficult without the use of costlyrefrigeration equipment, off-season plantingmay offer a solution. Importation of seedtubers is common in these regions, but mayentail higher costs and risks of late deliveryand deterioration in tuber quality along themarketing chain. Ware potatoes should be kept at a temperature of about 6 to 8°C, in a dark,well ventilated environment with highrelative humidity (85 to 90 percent). For processing purposes, such as the productionof french fries, storage temperatures mayrange up to 10°C to reduce the risk ofincreasing sugar levels, which areresponsible for a dark colour during frying.Potato darkening can also be caused by anexcess of nitrogen in the fertilizationformula. During transport of seed tubers and ware and processing potatoes, it is important toavoid bruising by reducing drop height,lining containers with rubber or other softmaterial, and avoiding extremetemperatures. Tubers should be protectedagainst unexpected rainfall and snow, whichcan occur at high altitudes. 29 GOOD AGRICULTURALPRATICESAND POTATOPRODUCTION PAPA, ALIMENTO DEL PUEBLO, CUBA.

Direct sunlight on potato seed should be avoided. Therefore: 3For long-term storage, store seed potatoes either at 2-4°C or, when stored at highertemperatures, in diffused light. 3The period between planting and emergence should be kept as short aspossible in order to make best use of theavailable growing season. Therefore, atplanting time the seed should be at aphysiological stage that allows a quickemergence. 3For planting, the best stage is phase III (robust sprouts having their typicalvarietal colour), the “normal multi-sprouting” phase. 3Put bulked seed potatoes in trays to stimulate more uniform sprouting.Seed size 3Use seed of uniform size, ranging from 25 to 50 mm or weighing between 30 to 80 g,depending on tuber size and shape. 3Plant tubers which have little variation in size. Using seed with a wide variation insize will not produce a uniform crop andmakes it more difficult to predict theplant density and properly manage thecrop. 3Use large tuber seed when soil and weather conditions at planting are unfavourable,the growing season is short, or where thereis the risk that during the first part of thegrowing season, the crop may be damagedby night frost, hail or drought. 3Large tubers may be cut into smaller pieces for planting to reduce seed costs andfavour a more uniform crop.

By using DLS, farmersare able to store their own seedstocks, instead of buying themfrom distant suppliers. However,the loading capacity of DLS islimited since all tubers must beexposed to the diffuse light.These stores are suitablegenerally for small seed unitsand not for large scale seedproduction schemes. Seedpotatoes stored in diffuse lightgive a more vigorous crop thanseed that has been stored for relatively long periods in the darkat higher temperatures.However, the DLS must beprotected against aphids (e.g.with an aphid proof screen) toavoid the risk of infection andtransmission of viruses such aspotato virus Y and potato leaf rollvirus. Since the aphid populationincreases throughout the storagephase, stringent controlmeasures need to be put in placeto reduce seed degeneration.

Due to itsrelatively poorly developed and shallow rootsystem, the potato demands a high level ofsoil nutrients. Without balanced fertilizationmanagement, growth and development ofthe crop are poor and both yield and qualityof tubers are diminished. The type and extent of nutrient management depends on the productionpotential of the area in which potatoes arecultivated and farmers’ productivityobjectives. Farmers should be advised toperform a soil test before application offertilizers – fertilization is highlydependent on location and blanketrecommendations are not applicable. Theyshould also be aware of the effect of the soilpH on nutrient supply and the type offertilizer to be used. Crop response to fertilizers varies from field to field. The fertilizer ratio of N-P-K oftenrecommended and practiced is usually 1:1:1.However, high yields and enhanced qualityof tubers can only be sustained through theapplication of optimal nutrient doses inbalanced proportions. Nitrogen. The amount of nitrogen applied to a potato crop varies from 100 to as muchGood practicesas 300 kg/ha depending on the purpose ofthe crop and soil characteristics.3Avoid high or excessive nitrogen dressing as it stimulates haulm growth, delaystuber formation and affects tuber quality(low dry matter content, high reducingsugar content and high protein andnitrate content). 3Apply nitrogen shortly before, or at, planting time. However, if there is a risk ofleaching (e.g. with heavy watering on lightsoils), or if the application of largequantities of fertilizer under dry conditionsmay cause scorching, a split applicationmay be better. The second nitrogenapplication should, in general, be given nolater than three to five weeks after cropemergence. Phosphorus.

Water deficit inthe early phase of yield formation increasesthe occurrence of spindled tubers (morenoticeable in oval than in round tubervarieties) and, when followed by irrigation,may result in tuber cracking or tubers with“hollow hearts”.

For ware and processing potatoes, storage aims at preventing “greening” and losses inweight and quality. In potato storage, thetwo critical environmental factors aretemperature and humidity. Adequate andunrestricted air movement is necessary tomaintain constant temperature andhumidity throughout the storage pile, and toprevent excessive shrinkage from moistureloss and decay. The storage temperatureaffects curing and wound healing processes,the spread and severity of disease, sugar-starch balances, and respiration.Respiration, in turn, influences dormancy orsprouting, and weight loss. High humidity isessential for optimum wound healingduring the curing period.

In addition,limited storage and transportfacilities can adversely affect thequality of tubers after harvest.Efforts to enhance the value chainwill only be successful providedthere are substantial levels ofpublic and private investment in the subsector, such as in breedingprogrammes, infrastructuralimprovements and initiatives tosupport and coordinate activitiesalong the chain. Policy-makersshould increase support to thesubsector, by – for example –extending to the potato sub-sector policies and resourcestraditionally focused on cerealsand on cash crops for export. Adding value in East Africa Enhancing the value chain and markets The Participatory Market Chain Approach With its adaptability to a wide range of uses, the potato has apotentially important role to playin the food systems of developing countries. In fact, in many countries, growthin urban populations, rising incomes anddietary diversification have led to rapidlyincreasing demand for potatoes from thefresh market, fast food, snack andconvenience food industries. The structuraltransformation of agriculture-basedeconomies into more urbanized societiesopens up new market opportunities forpotato growers and to their trading andprocessing partners in the value chain. Inorder to tap such potential, an efficientvalue chain for potato needs to beestablished. Often potatoes are purchased in the countryside by traders from cities, with verylimited negotiation and with prices decidedat the farm gate, resulting in an unevendistribution of income along the valuecreation chain. This leads to insufficientbuying power among potato growers and thedraining away of capital that could beinvested in rural areas to buildinfrastructure such as roads and improveeducation. 3Carry out consumer surveys to identify growing market segments and types ofproducts likely to be in demand in thenear future. Good practices3Develop and select cultivars that are preferred by consumers, processingindustries or local exporters. 3Use appropriate post-harvest practices and storage facilities to keep tubers in theirmost edible and marketable condition. 3To increase value, provide high quality ware potatoes or potato products toconsumers. 3Use simple market-oriented technologies that transform potato tubers into stablehigh quality products. 3Encourage farmer participation in producer groups and organizations inorder to increase their marketcompetitiveness and bargaining capacityand strengthen their position within thepotato value chain. 3Support participatory market chain approaches for potato (see box). 3Develop innovative marketing and utilization techniques linking small scalepotato producers to new marketopportunities. 3Promote mechanisms and approaches to link technology suppliers with farmers’needs, based on opportunities identifiedwithin a market chain framework. 3Organize growers in cooperatives for joint purchase of inputs such as fertilizers andfor joint processing and trading so that agreater proportion of the potato valuechain remains in the hands of producers.Potential areas of improvement63 KEY INDICATORS OFSUSTAINABILITYValue addition and markets 64 SUSTAINABLE POTATOPRODUCTION POTATO HARVESTING.

Tosupport domestic potato production, the Government ofPeru has offered low-incomepotato farmers emergency creditto maintain production and encourages Peruvians to eat agreater proportion of potatoes, thus boosting demand and prices.The government is also promoting the use of potatoes to make bread. A government-run foodcompany produces each day morethan 12 000 loaves made from one-third boiled and mashed potatoes and two-thirds wheatflour. Replacing a third of thewheat flour with mashedpotatoes or potato flour results in a soft, tasty bread that keeps well, and is more nutritious andcheaper than bread made from wheat only. Since January 2008, Peru’s prisons and many publicschools have been serving potatobread (papa pan). It is also sold byPlaza Vea, a Peruvian supermarketchain. More recently, the chief of Peru’s Sierra Exportadora, whichsupports farmer co-operatives, has called on Ministers to approve the construction of 100 potatoflour production plants to supply small and medium bakeries and even to export potato flour toEurope, Japan and the USA. “Papa pan” , a pro-potato policy solution POTATO STARCH.

This implies overcoming currenttrade barriers, including the lack ofharmonized transit charges and customsdocumentation. It also implies overcomingcurrent barriers to sustainable productionintensification based on good agriculturalpractices. Policy makers need to be more aware of the contribution that the potato is alreadymaking to development and food security,and of its importance as a staple food andcash crop in developing countries. In theprocess of revising poverty reduction strategypapers (PRSPs), and in formulatingstrategies for agricultural development, theyshould take into account the needs andpotentials of the potato subsector andsupport its more active engagement in thedevelopment process. One important policy aim in developing countries should be to enhance the value of potato production by establishing linksbetween farmers and food processors,improving credit availability, and fosteringpublic-private partnerships for technologyinnovation. By engaging interested partnersfrom the public and private sectors and civilsociety, policy can facilitate the developmentof focused country-level programmes,projects and activities to support asustainable potato subsector. Policy should also create a regulatory environment conducive to sustainablepotato development through support forknowledge enhancement and research,application of best management practices,and sharing and promotion of proven andadvanced potato technologies througheducation, extension and training. Policy should address constraints on potato-based production systems byfavouring the introduction of good qualityplanting material and potato varieties moreresistant to insect pests, diseases, waterscarcity and climate change, farmingsystems that can make optimum use ofnatural resources, seed certification schemesand soil testing laboratories. Policy will also have to secure financial commitments from national governments,donors and the private sector to invest inpotato-based systems and value chains.

Legislation is needed in many countries to set quality standards for seed and tointroduce or enforce mechanisms forcertification through accredited laboratories.Legislation may also be needed to protectpotato breeders’ rights. The potential effects of climate change pose a threat to the levels and stability ofpotato yields.

Cultivated in all continents except Antarctica, potato is an essential part of the diet of billions of people. Though developedcountries dominated potato production globally till 2005, there was a remarkableshift afterwards towards developing countries with a strong growth in production inAsia and Africa. Both potato production and consumption are accelerating in most ofthe developing countries with Africa showing the maximum growth now. The twoemerging Asian economies, viz. China and India together contribute nearly one thirdof the global potato production at present. Potato is preferred in these densely populated countries largely because of its high productivity, ﬂexibility in terms of ﬁtting into many prevailing cropping systems, and stable yields under conditions in which other crops may fail. Potato consumption in this region is increasing due toincreasing industrialization and participation of women in the job market that createddemand for processed, ready-to-eat convenience food, particularly in urban areas. Though potato emerged as an important food crop globally within about 400 years of its introduction from South America, it has also faced serious bioticthreats in the process.

A large number of fungal diseases including the infamous late blight and a plethora of insect pests are particularlyimportant causing signi ﬁcant direct and indirect losses to this crop thereby threaten- ing global food sustainability. Besides, vector-virus complexes constitute the mostimportant challenge worldwide for both seed and ware potato production. Thealready challenging pest and disease scenario in potato is getting exacerbated dueto intensive crop cultivation, climate change and its consequences on host resistance,and pathogen virulence as well as globalization of commodity trade. On the other side, considerable progress has now been made in the understanding of the molecular basis of plant –pathogen interactions, epidemiology of diseases and their causal agents, and the deployment of this knowledge to design suitable controland management methods. There has been an exponential growth in the number ofstudies unravelling the genetic and genomic basis of species interaction and pestbiology. Newer tools like RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 systems hold much potential towiden the gene pool for utilization in breeding pest and disease-resistant varietiesnow. As of now, the management of pests and diseases in potato is heavily reliant on v the use of plant protection products, which is not environmentally sustainable. Moreover, management schedules based on synthetic pesticides are rendered inef-fective due to continuous evolution of pathogen variants, resistance development, and emergence of new pests and diseases which usually were characterized as of minor importance. The global phenomenon of climate change is complicating thesituation further. In this book, an attempt has been made to bring together information on such aspects of pest and disease management which are believed to be more sustainable inthe long run. The 21 chapters of the book cover the essential aspects of pest anddisease management. The book is organized into two main themes —an overview of the major diseases like late bight of potato, other fungal, bacterial, nematode, and viral diseases with latest updates, and pests like aphids which are of global signi ﬁ- cance and recently emerged white ﬂies as major pests. The other theme includes chapters on areas of research and knowledge which have potential for sustainablepotato production, e.g. biological control, use of microbial secondary metabolites,green chemicals, and role of nutrition. Issues relating to pesticide residues, interna-tional phytosanitary measures, new chemistry pesticides which are mostly safer thanearlier generation chemicals, and management of pesticide resistance has also beendealt with in separate chapters. This book would be an excellent source of up-to-date information for the researchers working in the disciplines of plant pathology, agricultural entomology, and nematology in general, and potato researchers inparticular. It would also be a good source book for industries dealing with plantprotection, disease diagnostics, plant breeding, and agronomy of potato.

K. Chakrabarti, Sanjeev Sharma, and Mohd Abas Shah Abstract Potato is among the most important food crops round the world. Potato yield and quality is constrained by a myriad of insect pests and pathogens. Beyond doubt, the late blight of potato continues to be the most important disease of potato which can cause loses worth billions of dollars annually. Apart from the changing composition and intensity of the pests and diseases, the emergence of newer species/strains continues at an alarming rate. The impact of climate change is going to be profound on the crop as well as the pests and pathogens, of course the response is species speci ﬁc. The risk of the spread of invasive organisms of quarantine signi ﬁcance has increased many folds due to international trade and exchange of germplasm. On the other hand, the potato pest and disease manage- ment has come a long way, and several innovative approaches are being adopted for diagnostics and detection, monitoring and forecasting and management of various pest and diseases. In this chapter, an outline of the current issues of the potato pest and disease management is given along with a discussion on sustainability of the management practices. S. K.

Pres- ently, the crop is raised in 19 million hectares with 378 million tonnes globalproduction. The world has witnessed notable increase in potato production inmany countries during the last two decades because of area expansion andimprovements in yield. Global statistics indicate that potato production is shiftingtowards developing countries, especially in Asia and Africa, and potato productionin the developing countries has surpassed the developed world (FAOSTAT 2020 ). Worldwide, in 2018, China was the largest producer of potatoes, with India at second number (Fig. 1.1) (FAOSTAT 2020 ). More than a billion people consume potato on a regular basis, and it is a vital source of income for millions of farmers(Devaux et al. 2014 ). Though potato production has increased enormously since the 1960s in the developing world, but the sustainability of potato production globally isthreatened by adverse abiotic conditions, pests and pathogens. Potato is prone tomore than 100 pests and diseases including insects, nematodes, viruses, bacteria, Fig. 1.1 Potato production from 2000 to 2019 (Source: FAOSTAT 2020 )2 S. K. Chakrabarti et al. oomycete and fungi which cause direct yield losses and decrease of farmer ’s incomes by downgrading the quality of affected tubers. Due to climate change,global trade and increasing cropping intensity, pathogens are evolving at a faster rate and adapting to the new climate and hosts. As a consequence, health management is becoming more and more complex. Therefore, knowledge about the pathogens aswell as factors in ﬂuencing disease severity is needed to setup ef ﬁcient control strategies. The pest and disease management in potato is heavily reliant on the use of synthetic pesticides. Continued use of such plant protection products has led todevelopment of resistance, secondary pest outbreaks and pest resurgence on frequentbasis. Besides, the use of pesticides is generally harmful to mankind and the environment. Safer alternatives of pest and disease management are continuously being explored. Besides, the pest and disease management in potato is constraineddue to the effects of climate change and the risk of invasive pests. In this chapter,current issues of pest and disease management in potato are discussed to lay open theplatform for thorough discussions on the sustainable management of potato pets anddiseases which are described throughout the book. 1.2 Pests and Diseases of Potato: Economic Importance The potato is susceptible to many diseases. The oomycetes and the fungi rangingfrom moulds to the smuts and rusts perhaps constitute the most important biotic threats to potato. Potato is susceptible to numerous bacterial diseases, phytoplasmas, more than three dozen viruses of the yellow and mosaic groups and several parasiticnematodes. Diseases of potatoes include arguably the most historically signi ﬁcant crop disease, late blight, which is still the most important potato disease. Haverkortet al. ( 2009 ) estimated that the global costs and losses due to late blight may take 16% of all global potato production. At 100 €/t, the world potato production represents a value of €38 billion today. The 16% loss then represents an", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

After potato late blight, early blight represents one of the most important fungal diseases of potato today. Enormous yield losses are reported worldwide: 18 –39% in the United States (Harrison and Venette 1970 ), 2–40% in parts of Europe (Leiminger and Hausladen 2014 ), 20–50% in South Africa (Van der Waals et al. 2001 ) and>20% in Australia (Hors ﬁeld et al. 2010 ). In India, yield loss to the tune of 79% is recorded under severe condition. An increasing emphasis on the cosmetic appearance of potatoes has recently broughthitherto non-signi ﬁcant diseases into prominence. Unless effective methods of control are practiced, some of the diseases have the potential to cause the total loss of a crop. The economic importance and losses caused by various fungal, bacterial, viral and nematode diseases in potato crops are described in detail in respectivechapters. Insect pests are among the major constraints affecting the yield and quality of produce in potato. Variable losses are estimated across locations, with global lossesestimated on average at 16% (Oerke et al. 1994 ). Losses as high as 30% and 70% are1 Potato Pests and Diseases: A Global Perspective 3 recorded for various pests under different crop management regimes; complete crop losses or complete loss of quality seed crops is not a surprise if proper managementpractices are not adopted (Kroschel and Schaub 2013 ; Mujica and Kroschel 2013 ; Kroschel et al. 2020 ). A large number of insect pests infest potato crops. The insect may either damage the tubers directly or feed on leaves or stems and transmit debilitating pathogens(Radcliffe 1994 ). The latter result in loss of seed potato quality with severe consequences for the seed chain at multiple levels. Insect pests are also assigned toclasses as per convenience, namely, above-ground (indirect) and below-ground(direct) pests. Kroschel et al. ( 2020 ) described a total of 49 species of insect pests infesting potato crops in different parts of the world. Out of these, 6 major and 32 minor species are prevalent throughout the temperate, tropical and subtropical regions; 9 major species are prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and 2 majorspecies affect potato crops in the temperate regions. Although the composition ofmajor pests varies with many other factors, the Colorado potato beetle, aphids,leafhoppers, the potato psyllid, potato tuber moth, white ﬂy and wireworms are considered the deadliest insect pests of potato (Kroschel et al. 2012 ). Some of these pest species specialize on Solanaceae and have moved around the world along with the spread of potato cultivation. The Colorado potato beetle and potato tuber moth are the classic examples of this phenomenon. Other species are generalists with near cosmopolitan distribution like the aphids and mites. Mostregions in the world are also affected by regionally important pests such asthe beet leafhopper ( Circulifer tenellus (Baker)) in the north-west USA and the 28 spotted ladybird ( Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata (Fabr.)) in China. On the other hand, aphids are the major concern in prominent", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

The reverse istrue in most states of the United States and Canada. In India, aphids, white ﬂy (Bemisia tabaci ), numerous species of leaf hoppers, white grubs and cutworms are major pests (Shah et al. 2020 ). Among the global pests of potato, aphids are among the most important. Aphids are sap feeding insects, but the major damage in ﬂicted by aphids in potato crops is by transmission of numerous potato viruses. Theresulting viral diseases lead to considerable yield reductions, limit the productionof disease-free seed potatoes and cause a progressive degeneration of seed stocks.Worldwide, the most important concern for the production of quality seed potatoes isthe aphid-transmitted Potyvirus ,potato virus Y (PVY). Being a non-persistent virus that has been demonstrated of being transmitted by more than 60 species of aphids, PVY infection is the most dif ﬁcult to contain and is the most actively researched problem in potato pest management (Gray et al. 2010 ; Karasev and Gray 2013 ). Waters and Jensen ( 2014 ) proposed that the insect pest scenario for potatoes at a given location are related to the end-use markets (e.g. subsistence agriculture, tablestock, processing, long-term storage etc.) and the level of industrialization andaccess to insecticides and other crop protection technology. For example, potatotuber worm can be a pest of life-threatening proportions for subsistence farmers using rustic storage for food preservation, whereas it is a pest controlled easily by one or two well-timed insecticide treatments for technologically advanced farms4 S. K. Chakrabarti et al. with refrigerated storage. Conversely, an aphid-related disease such as potato virus Y (PVY) may be a minor yield-reducing concern for subsistence farming, butrepresents a nearly intractable problem and the difference between pro ﬁt and loss for technologically intensive farms. 1.2.1 Emerging Pests and Diseases Many of the important pests and diseases affecting potato can be regarded as emerging due to the attributes: (1) increase in incidence, geographical distributionor host range; (2) change in pathogenesis; (3) have newly evolved or (4) have beendiscovered or newly described (Anderson et al. 2004 ). The primary reasons for the occurrence of emerging pests and diseases are related to increased trade and travel,intensi ﬁed and expanded land use, changes in agricultural practices, planting of new varieties and extreme weather events linked to climate change (Fry et al. 2015 ). Though late blight ( Phytophthora infestans ) has historically been an important disease of potatoes, it is regarded as re-emerging disease due to regular emergenceof novel strains of the pathogen with increasing virulence and appearance in newlocations with surprising intensity (Fry et al. 2015 ). Multiple clonal lineages have been found across the globe that indicates the history of the displacement of lineagesover time. Migrations of exotic clonal lineages contribute substantially to change inthe population composition in most locations worldwide (Fry 2020 ). A complex population structure is observed in Europe with ~70% population dominated by a few widely disseminated clonal lineages ( www.euroblight.net ).", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}
{"id": "ICAR — “Sustainable Management of Potato Pests and Diseases”_10", "source_id": "ICAR — “Sustainable Management of Potato Pests and Diseases”", "title": "ICAR — “Sustainable Management of Potato Pests and Diseases”.pdf", "text": "Recently, declining trend in the combined frequency of the clones EU_13_A2, EU_6_A1 and EU_1_A1and increasing trend in the frequency of EU_36_A2, EU_37_A2, EU_41_A2 andEU_43_A2 have been observed in Europe (Cooke et al. 2019 ). Migration of the pathogen followed by selection has been the major causes of population change. Theepidemiological consequences of sexually reproducing populations have made lateblight management more dif ﬁcult due to early set of epidemics thereby demanding more fungicide applications (Hannukkala et al. 2007 ). The occurrence of fungicide resistance to ﬂuazinam (EU_37_A2) has further aggravated its management. Since the pathogen population is continually evolving and novel clonal lineages with newtraits are emerging, it is necessary to tailor management schedule to the localpathogen population. In recent years with warm and dry summers, early blight has become widespread and turned into one of most important diseases after late blight. In the past, potatodiseases caused by Alternaria species were described as early blight (caused by A. solani ) and brown spot (caused by A. alternata ) disease. Recent studies, however, showed that the Alternaria population on potato is much more elaborate than a two-species disease complex. Ten species of Alternaria have been implicated to cause foliar diseases of potato worldwide. These include A. solani ,A. alternata , A. tenuissima ,A. dumosa ,A. arborescens ,A. infectoria ,A. grandis ,A. interrupta , A. longipes andA. arbusti (Taheri et al. 2009 ; Ardestani et al. 2010 ; Rodrigues et al. 2010 ; Shoaib et al. 2014 ; Leiminger et al. 2015 ; Tymon et al. 2016 ).1 Potato Pests and Diseases: A Global Perspective 5 Bacterial diseases are other important biotic constraints, especially in tropical and subtropical regions and in some warm temperate regions of the world. About sevenbacterial diseases affect potato worldwide and cause severe damages especially on tubers. Bacterial wilt and black leg are considered the most important diseases, whereas potato ring rot, pink eye and common scab are the minor ones. Recently,Ralstonia species complex has been reclassi ﬁed on the basis of whole genome comparisons into three distinct species: R. solanacearum (Phylotype II), R. pseudosolanacearum (Phylotypes I and III) and R. syzygii (Phylotype IV) (Safni et al. 2014 ; Prior et al. 2016 ). Phylotype I strains are regarded to be of Asian origin, Phylotype II strains are thought to be of South American origin,whereas Phylotype III appears to have evolved in Africa and Phylotype IV in Indonesia. The R. solanacearum species complex is widely designated as a quaran- tine organism in many countries in an effort to prevent its movement acrossgeographical borders. Nevertheless, the PIIB1 strain has spread from its origin tomany potato-growing areas worldwide, presumably with movement in trade ofinfected seed tubers (Elphinstone 2005 ). Pectobacterium spp. are important bacterial potato pathogens and can be aggres- sive on tubers and stems causing wilting and eventually plant death. ThePectobacterium species most commonly found on potato include P. atrosepticum , P. brasiliense ,P. carotovorum ,P. odoriferum ,P. parmentieri ,P. peruviense , P. polaris andP. punjabense.

For example, P. atrosepticum , P. brasiliense ,P. parmentieri andP. carotovorum are found on multiple continents (Pérombelon and Kelman 1987 ; Duarte et al. 2004 ; Kim et al. 2009 ; Pitman et al. 2008 ,2010 ; van der Merwe et al. 2010 ; De Boer et al. 2012 ; Ngadze et al. 2012 ; She et al. 2017 ; van der Wolf et al. 2017 ; Wang et al. 2017a ,b,c). In Europe, P. atrosepticum has been the predominant species responsible for blackleg disease on potato, while P. carotovorum is often associated with soft rot in storage. P. brasiliense was originally identi ﬁed as causing disease on potato in Brazil (Duarte et al. 2004 ) and has been common in the United States since 2001, as also P. parmentieri (Yap et al. 2004 ; Kim et al. 2009 ). This species was not known to cause disease on potato in Europe prior to 2012 –2013 but has since increased greatly in its incidence in many European countries (de Werra et al. 2015 ) and is now recognized as an important pathogen in Africa as well (van der Merwe et al. 2010 ). Dickeya species (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi ) have emerged as a new threat to potato production in Europe. Like Pectobacterium ,Dickeya species have also a wide host range with global distribution (Samson et al. 2005 ). Out of eight Dickeya species, only D. dianthicola andD. solani are of concern to potato (Toth et al. 2011 ). In some cases, D. dianthicola replaced P. atrosepticum as the dominant blackleg pathogen (Parkinson et al. 2009 ; Toth et al. 2011 ).D. solani has been recognized as a newDickeya pathogen on potato by several groups from 2004 through 2010 (Laurila et al. 2008 ; Parkinson et al. 2009 ; Slawiak et al. 2009 ) and spreading across Europe on seed tubers. Zebra chip (ZC), a new and economically important disease of potato in the United States, Mexico, Central America and New Zealand, is caused by the6 S. K. Chakrabarti et al. bacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso) ”and transmitted to potato by the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli . Although Lso is only spread in potato byB. cockerelli , it can also be found in other Bactericera species, suggesting that vector feeding preferences limit the species of vectors important for zebra chip and not Lso-vector interactions (Borges et al. 2017 ). These observations suggest that the bacterium can easily be introduced in many parts of the world along with its insectvectors. Insect pests such as the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), and the leafminer ﬂy,Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard), have become invasive and occur today as serious pests in many tropical and subtropical regions. Around 2006,the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta Meyrick, although a minor pest in potato, was unintentionally introduced to Spain, from where it continued its devastating journey across Africa and into Asia and reached India within less than 10 years (Rahmanet", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}
{"id": "ICAR — “Sustainable Management of Potato Pests and Diseases”_12", "source_id": "ICAR — “Sustainable Management of Potato Pests and Diseases”", "title": "ICAR — “Sustainable Management of Potato Pests and Diseases”.pdf", "text": "al. 2012 ; Caparros Megido et al. 2013 ; Sridhar et al. 2015 ; Kanle Satishchandra et al. 2019 ). As farmers had not been prepared and no control measures had been in place, the pest caused large production losses in tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.); under certain conditions, potato was more heavily infested as known fromSouth America. The bud midge, Prodiplosis longifolia Gagne, currently with a restricted distribution in Florida and Virginia and South America (Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador) could become an invasive species supported by its very polyphagous feeding habit. Lately, the fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is threatening crops across globe with very fast rate ofspread. Potato could be a potential host for the fall armyworm in tropical andsubtropical potato crops, e.g. in India (Yu 1982 ; Sidana et al. 2018 ; Nagoshi et al. 2019 ). Potato is a temperate crop; however, efforts at breeding day neutral and high temperature tolerance have enabled tropicalisation of the crops. This phenomenon exposed the potato crops to some of the insect pests which are mainly prevalent in the warmer regions located in tropics or the subtropics. The potato cultivation inIndia is a major example of this type of pest shift. More than 85% of potatoproduction in India is realized from the tropical and subtropical regions where thesweetpotato white ﬂy,Bemisia tabaci , is a major pest of the potato now (Shah et al. 2021a ). To worsen the situation, we saw the evolution of the potato-speci ﬁc Begomovirus ,tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus [potato] around two decades back (Usharani et al. 2004 ; Kumar et al. 2021 ). The white ﬂy-virus complex is the major concern for quality seed potato production in India (Shah et al. 2020 ,2021a ). 1.3 Effect of Climate Change on Occurrence and Distribution of Potato Pests and Diseases Climate change is a reality, and it has impact on infection, reproduction, dispersal and survival between seasons and other critical stages in the life cycle of a pathogen.Studies have shown that, assuming global temperature rise by 2 /C14C, there will be lower risk of late blight in warmer areas ( <22/C14C) and higher risk in cooler areas1 Potato Pests and Diseases: A Global Perspective 7 (>13/C14C) at global level. However, earlier onset of warm temperatures could result in an early appearance of late blight disease in temperate regions with the potentialfor more severe epidemics and increased number of fungicide applications needed for its control. Similar predictions have been made for Finland where for each 1 /C14C warming, late blight would occur 4 –7 days earlier, and with the susceptibility period extended by 10 –20 days (Kaukoranta 1996 ) resulting in 1 –4 additional fungicide applications. In United Kingdom, hotter and drier summers are likely to reduce theimportance of late blight, although earlier disease onset may act in opposite direc-tion. An empirical climate-disease model has suggested that under the climatechange scenario of 1 /C14C temperature increase with 30% reduction in precipitation in", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Increase in both temperature and RH has added new dimension to late blight across the world. Under such a situation, P. infestans is likely to attack potato stems more often than foliage. In fact, in recent years it is more of “stem blight ”than the foliar blight. This phase of the disease is more serious than the foliar stage as itaffects the very crop plant. In India, Lahaul valley of HP, which was earlier free fromlate blight because of lack of precipitation, has now experienced attack of late blightdue to occurrence of rainfall (Singh et al. 2013 ). Studies on the potential impact of climate change on late blight outbreak in Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh revealed that a higher number of sprays would be required in Punjab, whereas there would be no change or it is likely to be reduced in western Uttar Pradesh under future scenario(Dua et al. 2015 ). Shortest incubation period at higher temperature (28 /C14C) is on records for Phytophthora infestans (Becktell et al. 2005 ). The effect of climate change on soilborne pathogens would vary from pathogen to pathogen. Black scurf and common scab diseases are favoured by moderate temper-ature and are likely to remain insulated from global warming in the near future.However, as the ambient temperatures are likely to increase by 1.4 –5.8 /C14C by the end of the century, the severity of these two diseases may decrease substantially. Charcoal rot, which is favoured by high temperature and moisture, is currentlyendemic in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, andthe severity of this disease is likely to increase in these regions under globalwarming. Moreover, it is also expected that it may expand to other parts of north-central plains as well. Sclerotium wilt is restricted to plateau regions and is favoured by high temperature and moisture. With the increase in temperature due to globalwarming, the disease may also become prevalent in eastern Indo-Gangetic plains and may also enter into other areas like mid hills. Similarly, bacterial wilt may also advance to higher altitudes in hilly regions due to global warming, making themunﬁt for seed production. Diseases caused by Synchytrium endobioticum (wart) and Spongospora subterranea (powdery scab) are favoured by low temperature and high soil moisture. Although wart spores can cause infection in the range of 10 –28 /C14C with an optimum of 21/C14C, there is hardly any infection beyond 23/C14C. Therefore, warmer climates are likely to reduce wart infestation. Similarly, powdery scab infestation is also likely to be reduced with increase in temperature and reduction in rainfall under climate change scenario. The optimum temperature for powdery scab is 12/C14C, and moisture8 S. K. Chakrabarti et al. requirement is 100%; the global warming may either lead to elimination of this disease or be pushed to higher altitudes making high hills (2500 m asl) free ofpowdery scab (Singh et al. 2013 ). The Pectobacterium species also differ in optimal", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

For example, P. atrosepticum and P. parmentieri die above 33 /C14C, while P. carotovorum and P. brasiliense can grow at temperatures up to 39/C14C; hence the former two species may get eliminated, whereas the later may expand to new horizons (Charkowski 2015 ) under climate change scenario. Among other phenomena, the impact of climate change on the crop and the associated insect pest complex is likely to be substantial (Hijmans 2003 ; Minhas et al. 2018 ; Raymundo et al. 2018 ; Rana et al. 2020 ; Shah et al. 2021b ). It is being realized that insect species can respond to climate change in a multitude of ways, mainly in anticipation of a generally warmer and drier environment rich in CO 2 predicted through climate change general circulation models (IPCC 2013 ). Insect species may shift their geographic distributions or phenology in an attempt to trackchanges in their optimal conditions. Within ectotherms and endotherms alike, thereis substantial evidence of range shifts already occurring, particularly towards thepoles where temperatures are increasing; with recent evidence also suggesting, this isthe case for pest species (Bebber et al. 2013 ). There are several reported cases of phenological change with the environment in insect pests. Crop damage due to insect pests may increase due to higher number of generations in a season, i.e. increasedvoltinism. Based on a day-degree model, an increased number of suitable days fordevelopment could allow faster generation time and, therefore, an additional gener-ation (or possibly even two) to develop within a growing season (Barton andTerblanche 2014 ). Climatic response phenology models have been used to assess the effect of temperature increase under projected changes in global temperature for the year 2050 and beyond for a wide range of potato pests (as summarized by Kroschel et al. 2020 ):P. operculella (Kroschel et al. 2013 ,2016 );L. huidobrensis (Mujica et al. 2016 ); Guatemalan potato tuber moth, Tecia solanivora (Povolny) (Schaub et al. 2016 ); Andean potato tuber moth, Symmetrischema tangolias (Gyen) (Sporleder et al. 2016 ); the white ﬂies, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius); and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Gamarra et al. 2016a ,b). As mentioned above, the geographical range of most of these is likely to expand with increased damagepotential. However, the response is likely to be species speci ﬁc. The deadly leafminer ﬂy,L. huidobrensis , will expand in range to temperate regions of Asia, North and South America and Europe, as well as into subtropical and tropicalmountainous regions with a moderate increase of its establishment and damagepotential (Mujica et al. 2016 ). Even smaller changes in temperature predicted for tropical regions compared to temperate regions will have stronger consequences onpest development due to already higher existing metabolism rates of organisms suchas insects (Dillon et al. 2010 ).1 Potato Pests and Diseases: A Global Perspective 9 1.4 Pests and Pathogens of Quarantine Significance All the pests and pathogens are not present everywhere.

It is important for each nation to develop a plant bio-securityinfrastructure that ensures a safe and constant supply of food, feed and ﬁbre. It is equally important to develop an international framework for cooperation thatmaintains plant bio-security without compromising trade. The devastating effectsresulting from diseases and pests introduced along with international movement ofplanting material, agricultural produce and products are well documented. Thehistorical Irish famine of 1845, caused by late blight of potato introduced from Central America, coffee rust introduced in Sri Lanka in 1875, ﬂuted scale on citrus, San Jose scale in apples, banana bunchy top, the dreaded Golden nematode infestingpotatoes, wart pathogen and the noxious weed Lantana camara introduced in 1809 from Central America are glaring examples that clearly demonstrate that introduc-tion and establishment of quarantine pests including weeds into new areas canseverely damage the crop production and economy of a region/country. Movementof plants and plant products between bio-geographical zones by human activities isnow generally accepted to be the primary mode of introduction of exotic pathogens and pests. Potato is usually propagated through tubers, and this vegetative mode of propa- gation is beset with many problems; hence, there is continuous threat of theirintroduction into new areas with planting material. In most of the countries, thefollowing pests and pathogens are regarded as quarantined viz., potato tuber nema-tode ( Ditylenchus destructor ), stem and bulb nematode ( Ditylenchus dipsaci) , potato cyst nematodes ( Globodera rostochiensis ,G. pallida ), gangrene ( Phoma exigua var. foeta ), potato wart ( Synchytrium endobioticum ), potato smut ( Thecaphora solani ), bacterial ring rot ( Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus ), Colorado potato beetle ( Leptinotarsa decemlineata ), Andean potato weevil ( Premnotrypes spp.) and viruses (Andean potato latent, Andean potato mottle, arracacha B virus, potatodeforming mosaic, potato T, potato yellow dwarf, potato yellow vein, potato calicostrain of tobacco ring spot virus, potato strains of tobacco streak virus and potatopurple-top wilt and stolbur Phytoplasmas ), which might establish in the country and hamper potato production programme. The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), native to Mexico, has spread across most of the United States and was introduced into France in the 1920s from where it spread further reaching also parts of China (CABI 2017 ). Insect pests such as the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), and the leafminer ﬂy,Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard), with their centre of origin in the Andes have spread to and establishedin many tropical and subtropical regions.10 S.

The recent advances in arti ﬁcial intelligence coupled with increasing global smartphone penetration have paved the way forsmartphone-assisted disease diagnosis (Johnson et al. 2021 ). There are android- based mobile apps available for download on smartphones which can diagnose a disease based on the pictures of the disease symptoms captured on the device. These apps have an expert-based algorithm of expert system which not only diagnoses thedisease but gives advisories for the suitable management. One such plant diseasediagnosis app “plantix ”can detect more than 400 pathogens of 30 crops and has about ten million users worldwide ( https://plantix.net ).Interestingly, the app may further provide the advisories to minimize the disease outbreak in the next croppingseason. Theﬁrst ever deep learning neural network platform in detection of potato diseases has been developed recently. Oppenheim et al. ( 2019 ) reported the detection of four economically important potato diseases viz., black scurf, common scab,silver scurf and black dot with more than 90% accuracy. The two devastatingdiseases of potato viz., early blight and late blight, were also being detected usingthis neural network. Recently, a cost-effective smartphone-based volatile organiccompound (VOC) ﬁngerprinting platform has been developed which allows non-invasive diagnosis of late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans (Li et al. 2019 ).This VOC-sensing platform is portable and easy to handle and can perform multiplex detection by classi ﬁcation of ten plant volatiles at a time. In fact, the symptomless plants having fungal infection may also be detected using this sensor-based platform. The approach will supplement the lab-based routine moleculardetection and will become a viable additional method to help prevent major yieldlosses in potato. E-nose technology has gained popularity for its applications in a ﬁeld of human diagnostics, food quality and environmental safety. The technology is a quick andeasily operated, rapid responding ﬂexible tool to recognize signature gas samples (Cellini et al. 2017 ). The main operating principle relies in chemical interaction and electrical conductivity of sensors and resultant variations in the signature molecules.The e-nose basically comprises of an array of sensors with different sensibilitiesagainst diverse chemicals with diverse functional groups. The sensor generateselectrical signals which correspond to the gas composition of the sample, andhence unique e-nose pro ﬁles are created which may be matched with a diverse pool of reference samples. Several plant materials infected with pathogenic bacteriaor fungi have been subjected to e-nose-based detection, and potato is no exception.1 Potato Pests and Diseases: A Global Perspective 11 The earliest detection of potato pathogen using e-nose tool was utilized in 2004 where researchers developed generic system for detection of statuary potato patho-gen causing ring rot and bacterial wilt in potato (Stinson 2007 ). An advancement in e-nose-based detection system of the same disease came in 2014, when a commercial electronic nose (e-nose) having metal oxide sensor array was developed thatrecognizes volatile compounds emitted by potatoes experimentally infected withRalstonia solanacearum orClavibacter michiganensis subsp . sepedonicus , which are bacterial agents of", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

An e-nose gas chamber and sampling device was designed to detect the volatileproﬁles in soft rot infected potato tubers. The developed device utilized RBF NN algorithm and SVM algorithm and detected soft rot in tubers with accuracy as high as 89%. Likewise, there is a report of detection of soft rot in potatoes caused by the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum through the use of an array of low-cost gas sensors. These researchers utilized the strong odour emitted by rot infected potato inthe cold stores and devised a low-cost gas sensor to detect the disease based onsignature molecules. Under lab conditions, they demonstrated that out of 11 sensorsused, 3 were able to detect the soft rot infected tubers with 100% accuracy (Rutoloet al. 2018 ). The identi ﬁed sensors therefore offer promise for an automated in-store monitoring system. E-nose technology has signi ﬁcantly progressed since the ﬁrst attempts of application to plant diagnosis and may become mature in a near future. It is worthwhile to point to some valuable publications on the subject of potato entomology, e.g. Giordanengo et al. ( 2013 ), the insect-related portions of Potato Health Management (Johnson 2007 ) and the basic biology of several insect- transmitted diseases as discussed in Stevenson et al. ( 2001 ). Numerous ﬁeld manuals for identifying potato pests have been published, e.g. Zehnder et al. ( 1994 ), Strand and Rude ( 2006 ) and Johnson ( 2007 ). Other suggested readings include Navarre and Pavek ( 2014 ) and Kroschel et al. ( 2020 ). 1.6 Development in the Area of Pest/Disease Forecasting Though the chemical-based management of pests and diseases are still dominating, their use can be rationalized. This can be achieved through the use of forecastingmodels and decision support systems (DSSs). Forecasting allows a better control of adisease and a more ef ﬁcient use of fungicides by making informed disease manage- ment decisions; whereas, the DSS-based strategy can deliver general or site-speci ﬁc information to the stakeholders enabling them to take ﬁrm decisions on the manage- ment thereby resulting in economic gains and environment protection (Cooke et al.2011 ; Sharma 2019 ). Various late blight forecasting models and DSSs have been developed across the globe for the management of late blight in different agro- ecologies and are discussed in Chap. 7. Degree-day models are routinely used for predicting the emergence or build-up of insect population for various insect pests like potato tuber moth, the Andean tuberworms ( Symmetrischema tangolias andTecia solanivora ), Colorado potato beetle, other potato beetles, potato psyllids, leaf hoppers etc. in different parts of the world12 S. K. Chakrabarti et al. (Keller 2003 ; Sporleder et al. 2004 ; Giordanengo et al. 2013 ). The most impactful is perhaps monitoring of the ﬂight activity of aphids and forecasting the extent of the risk of PVY spread in seed potato crops. Extensive aphid monitoring programmes using suction traps have been running successfully in European countries, the", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

The oldest network is in the United Kingdom,which has been running for more than 50 years.

This warrants the development of novel and future-oriented management strategies whichare rapid, easy to operate and implicate, cost effective, widely applicable and wellautomated in the era of computer-based modernization. There is certainly gooddevelopment in this direction, and novel futuristic techniques are emerging in potatofarming, some are being adopted, while others are expected to be followed in thenear future (Sharma and Tiwari 2021 ). The development and manufacture of effec- tive, safe to humans and environmentally friendly pesticides have been a challenge and an important target. The general trends and strategies for novel pesticidesinclude development of pesticides that are effective at an extremely low dosage,development of pesticides that are readily degradable and less residual in theenvironment and development of selective toxic agrochemicals. These developmentstrategies have become increasingly prominent. The most developed fungicides aresuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI), demethylation inhibitors (DMI) andinhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III, i.e. quinone outside inhibitors (QoI) and quinone inside inhibitors (QiI). Due to the development of resistance to fungicides with existing modes of action, the second general trend isthe development of fungicides with a novel mode of action and a unique chemicalstructure, and many fungicides possessing these traits have been launched or areunder development. Other trends are the development of novel plant defenceactivators and novel natural product origin fungicides (Umetsu and Shirai 2020 ). “Oxathiapiprolin ”(Zorvec™, Orondis ™) is a new class of piperidinyl thiazole isoxazoline fungicide effective against several fungal diseases, including downy mildew and late blight on crops such as vegetables, ornamentals and turf. Its mode of action involves binding to the oxysterol-binding protein in oomycetes (Hagiwaraet al. 2019 ). Plant-associated bacteria contribute to their host ’s health in diverse ways, among which the emission of disease inhibiting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is oneoption. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the plant microbiota have1 Potato Pests and Diseases: A Global Perspective 13 been demonstrated to elicit plant defences and inhibit the growth and development of numerous plant pathogens. The inhibitory impact of volatiles emitted by Pseudomo- nasspecies against late blight has been shown by impeding mycelial growth and sporangia germination of P. infestans (Bailly and Weisskopf 2017 ). The VOCs containing sulphur compound S-methyl methane thiosulfonate (MMTS) hadshown high in planta protective potential against late blight without phytotoxic effects. This protective activity of MMTS is", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

This provides new perspectives for plant protection by opening new research avenues on the role ofVOCs in the interaction between plants and their microbiome and thus could helpselect for ef ﬁcient biocontrol strategies and lead to a greener chemical disease management in the ﬁeld. Genome editing or gene editing has opened new opportunities to introduce sequence-speci ﬁc modi ﬁcations into the genomes of organisms and in the identi ﬁ- cation, characterization and validation of resistant genes coupled with their deploy-ment in suitable cultivars for the development of disease resistance (Schenke et al.2020 ). Genome editing technologies such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) have become powerful genetic tools for increasing pathogen resistance in plants (Zhan et al. 2019 ). The novel opportunities provided by genome editing, synthetic biology and gene drive may give immensesupport in managing diseases caused by viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens inpotato. A recent study revealed that mutation of a single gene in Arabidopsis, DMR6 (downy mildew resistance 6), led to increased salicyclic acid levels and resistance toseveral plant pathogens, including bacteria and oomycetes (Zeilmaker et al. 2014 ). Interestingly, the tomato orthologous SIDMR6 –1 is also upregulated in response to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pvtomato and Phytophthora capsici . Null mutants of SIDMR6 –1 generated via CRISPR/Cas9 system showed resistance to P. syringae ,P. capsici andXanthomonas spp. without detrimental effects on tomato growth and development (Thomazella et al. 2016 ). Together, these results suggest that knocking out DMR6 may be a promising strategy to confer broad spectrum disease resistance to plants. A related but advanced system CRISPR/Cas13a iseffective to cleave single-stranded RNA, thus providing protection against RNAviruses in plant. Recently, a study reported the reframing of CRISPR/Cas13a toprotect the potato plants from Potato virus Y (PVY) (Zhan et al. 2019 ). Four of the PVY target region P3 protein (potyviral membrane protein), CI (cytoplasmic inclu- sion bodies), NIb (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and CP (coat protein) wereselected and used for sgRNA design. There was a suppressed PVY accumulation,and symptoms were attenuated in transgenic potato lines expressing small guideRNA (Cas13a/sgRNA). Another innovative approach is to target susceptibilitygenes (S-genes) which are bene ﬁcial for pathogens ’growth and development. Silencing of S genes attenuates the disease symptoms as observed in severaleconomically important crops such as rice, wheat, tomatoes, citrus etc. A recent study by Kieu et al. ( 2021 ) reported that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing-mediated induced mutations in susceptibility genes confer increased late blight resistance in14 S. K. Chakrabarti et al. potatoes. A tetra-allelic deletion mutant (conferring co-expression of two guide RNAs) was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting seven putative Sgenes including two DMR6 potato homologues. The mutant plants assayed for late blight resistance have shown signi ﬁcantly high level of resistance as compared to control. Presently, the exogenous application of double-stranded RNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and hpRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

The manage- ment of late blight disease in potato was also made possible using dsRNA-basedspray formulations. A latest study reported that spraying of Phytophthora infestans derived dsRNA molecules as an effective plant protection strategy for the manage- ment of potato late blight (Sundaresha et al. 2021 ). Overall dsRNA-based spray formulation was highly effective in mitigating late blight disease symptoms, and thiscan be an effective strategy alternative to chemical pesticides. In fact, many studieshave been found effective in managing vector populations using dsRNA-basedspray, and this can be utilized in managing white ﬂies and aphids in potato produc- tion system (Arif et al. 2012 ; Thakur et al. 2014 ). It is well reported that white ﬂy mortality has been induced via oral delivery of dsRNA, targeting ﬁve important genes namely actin ortholog, ADP/ATP translocase, α-tubulin, ribosomal protein L9 (rpl9) and v-ATPase A. There was enhanced white ﬂy resistance in transgenic tobacco plants expressing dsRNA of v-ATPase gene (Thakur et al. 2014 ). Similarly, dsRNA-based spray formulations targeting potential RNAi target genes (TREH,ATPD, ATPE and CHS1) were selected and cloned and further tested through thetransdermal dsRNA delivery system against soybean aphids. The delivered dsRNAsilenced the gene expressions of target genes with mortality rate up to 81.67%. Suchkind of novel, ecofriendly and highly target-speci ﬁc formulations are the need of the hour for simultaneous management of virus and vector populations. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones are becoming increasingly popular in the era of precision agriculture. The drones are excellent in terms of speed of itscoverage of large area much faster than humans so they can be a valuable scoutingtool especially if other sensors are also equipped in it. The advancement in imageprocessing and machine learning tools has evolved to such an extent that it cangenerate useful information for the management of the farm (Sugiura et al. 2018 ). There are several successful examples of drone-based monitoring and redressal of various abiotic and biotic stresses in commercial crop plants. Multispectral, thermal and hyperspectral images are the preferred methods of acquiring information indisease monitoring. The drone-based disease diagnostics has been used for potatodiseases. Sugiura et al. ( 2018 ) devised RGB sensor-based UAV for the detection of PVY-infected plants. Likewise, the late blight phenotyping, disease progression wasalso assessed in potato using similar RGB-based UAVs (Sugiura et al. 2016 ). The spectral imaging based system also captured disease progression and provided areaunder disease progress curve (AUDPC) as phenotypic data.

There is a growing awareness world over on the need for promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture practices. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a globally accepted strategy for promoting sustainable agriculture. During last century, IPM relied substantially on economic threshold level and chemical pesticides driven approaches. However, since the late 1990s there is conscious shift to more ecologically sustainable Agro-Eco System Analysis (AESA) based IPM strategies. The AESA based IPM focuses on the relationship among various components of an agro-ecosystem with special focus on pest-defender dynamics, innate abilities of plant to compensate for the damages caused by the pests and the influence of abiotic factors on pest buildup. In addition, Ecological Engineering for pest management - a new paradigm to enhance the natural enemies of pests in an agro- ecosystem is being considered as an important strategy. The ecological approach stresses the need for relying on bio intensive strategies prior to use of chemical pesticides. Sincere efforts have been made by resource personnel to incorporate ecologically based principles and field proven technologies for", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Over the years IPM underwent several changes, shifting its focus from damage boundary, economic injury to economic threshold. Currently most stake holders rely upon economic threshold levels (ETL) and tend to apply chemical pesticides at the first instance in the event of a pest attack, through Government of India has advocated need based and judicious application of chemicals. This approach is likely to cause adverse effects on agro-ecosystems and increase the cost of agricultural production due to problems of pest resurgence, insecticide resistance and sustainability. During the late 90s FAO started advocating Agro-Ecosystem Analysis (AESA) based IPM. Experience in different countries have sine show that AESA, which takes into account ecological principles and relies on the balance that is maintained by biotic factors in an ecosystem has also resulted in reduction in cost of production and increase in yields. AESA based IPM also takes into account the need for active participation of farmers and promotes experiential learning and discovery based decision making by farmers. AESA based IPM in conjunction with ecological engineering for pest management promotes bio-intensive strategies as against current chemical intensive approaches, while retaining the option to apply chemical pesticides judiciously as a measure of last resort. The resource persons of NIPHM and DPPQ&S have made sincere efforts in revising IPM packages for different crops by incorporating agro-ecosystem analysis, ecological engineering, pesticide application techniques and other IPM options with the active cooperation of crop based plant protection scientists working in state Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutions. I hope this IPM package will serve as a ready reference for extension functionaries of Central / State Governments, NGOs and progressive farmers in adopting sustainable plant protection strategies by minimizing the dependence on chemical pesticides.

In AESA based IPM the whole agro-ecosystem, plant health at different stages, built-in-compensation abilities of the plant, pest and defender population dynamics, soil conditions, climatic factors and farmers’ past experience are considered. In AESA, informed decisions are taken by farmers after field observation, AESA chart preparation followed by group discussion and decision making. Insect zoo is created to enable the farmer understand predation of pests by Natural Enemies. AESA based PHM also results in reduction of chemical pesticide usage and conserves the agro-ecosystems. Ecological Engineering for Pest Management, a new paradigm, is gaining acceptance as a strategy for promoting Biointensive Integrated Pest Management. Ecological Engineering for Pest Management relies on cultural practices to effect habitat manipulation and enhance biological control. The strategies focus on pest management both below ground and above ground. There is growing need to integrate AESA based IPM and principles of ecological engineering for pest management. There is a rising public concern about the potential adverse effects of chemical pesticides on the human health, environment and biodiversity. The intensity of these negative externalities, through cannot be eliminated altogether, can be minimized through development, dissemination and promotion of sustainable biointensive approaches. Directorate of Plant Protection Quarantine and Storage (DPPQS), has developed IPM package of practices during 2001 and 2002. These packages are currently providing guidance to the Extension Officers in transferring IPM strategies to farmers. These IPM package of practices, have been revised incorporating the principles of AESA based IPM in detail and also the concept of Ecological Engineering for Pest Management. It is hoped that the suggested practices, which aim at enhancing biodiversity, biointensive strategies for pest management and promotion of plant health, will enable the farmers to take informed decisions based on experiential learning and it will also result in use of chemical pesticides only as a last resort & in a safe and judicious manner.

The potato originated from South America, most likely from the central Andes in Peru. The potato was domesticated and has been grown by indigenous farming communities for over 4,000 years. Introduced into Europe in the sixteenth century, the crop subsequently was distributed throughout the world, including Asia. Worldwide, the potato comes fourth in terms of production after wheat, maize, and rice. In many countries potato serves as their major staple food because of its excellent nutritional content. It can supplement the food needs of the country in a substantial way as it produces more dry-matter food, has well balanced protein and produces more calories from unit area of land and time than other major food crops. There is a great potential of exporting potatoes from India both for seed and table purposes to our neighbouring countries of South-East Asia and to Middle East countries. Potatoes can even be exported to some of the European countries during March-May when fresh potatoes are not available in these countries. The present area under potato in India is about 1.5 million hectares. India ranks fifth in production after China, Russian Federation, Poland and Ukraine. Potato is basically a crop of temperate region but there is a large variation in the gene pool with respect to crop's response to thermo periods. Generally potato crop is raised in India when maximum temperatures are below 35°C and minimum temperatures are below 200C with ideal tuberization temp. between 16-220C. The potato plant is a herbaceous perennial in that it lacks a woody stem and lives more than two years. It grows 90 to 100 centimetres (3 to 4 feet) tall and is covered with dark green leaves . The above-ground part of the plant dies each winter and re-grows in spring. 2 AESA based IPM – PotatoI. PESTS A. Pests of National Significance 1.

The health of a plant is determined by its environment which includes physical factors (i.e. sun, rain, wind and soil nutrients) and biological factors (i.e. pests, diseases and weeds). All these factors can play a role in the balance which exists between herbivore insects and their natural enemies. Understanding the intricate interactions in an ecosystem can play a critical role in pest management. Decision making in pest management requires a thorough analysis of the agro-ecosystem. Farmer has to learn how to observe the crop, how to analyze the field situation and how to make proper decisions for their crop management. This process is called the AESA. Participants of AESA will have to make a drawing on a large piece of paper (60 x 80 cm), to include all their observations. The advantage of using a drawing is that it requires the participants to observe closely and intensively. It is a focal point for the analysis and for the discussions that follow, and the drawing can be kept as a record. AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyze the field situations with regards to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health and the influence of climatic factors and their relationship for growing a healthy crop. The basic components of AESA are: • Plant health at different stages • Built-in compensation abilities of plants • Pest and defender population dynamics • Soil conditions • Climatic factors • Farmers past experience Principles of AESA based IPM: Grow a healthy crop • Select a variety resistant/tolerant to major pests • Select healthy seed/seedling/planting material tubers • Treat the seed/seedling/planting material tuber with recommended pesticides especially biopesticides • Follow proper spacing • Soil health improvement (mulching and green manuring whereeve applicable) • Nutrient management through fertilizers especially organic manures and biofertilizers based on the soil test results. If the dosage of nitrogenous fertilizers is too high the crop becomes too succulent and therefore susceptible to insects and diseases. If the dosage is too low, the crop growth is retarded. So, the farmers should apply an adequate amount of fertilizers for best results. The phosphatic fertilizers should not be applied each and every season as the residual phosphate of the previous season will be available for the current season also. • Proper irri gation • Crop rotation AESA based IPM – Potato5Observe the field regularly (climatic factors, soil and biotic factors): Farmers should • Monitor the field situation at least once a week (soil, water, plants, pests, natural enemies, weather factors etc.) • Make decisions based on the field situation and Pest: Defender ratio (P: D ratio) • Take direct action when needed (e.g. collect egg masses, remove infested plants etc.) Plant compensation ability: Compensation is defined as the replacement of plant biomass lost to herbivores and has been associated with increased photosynthetic rates and mobilization of stored resources from source organs to sinks (e.g. from roots and remaining leaves to new", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Plant tolerance to herbivory can arise from the interaction of a variety of plant traits and external environmental factors. Several studies have documented such compensation through increased growth and photosynthetic rate. Understand and conserve defenders: • Know defenders/natural enemies to understand their role through regular observations of the agro- ecosystem • Avoid the use of chemical pesticides especially with broad-spectrum activity Insect zoo: In field various types of insects are present. Some are beneficial and some may be harmful. Generally farmers are not aware about it. Predators (friends of the farmers) which feed on pests are not easy to observe in crop field. Insect zoo concept can be helpful to enhance farmers’ skill to identify beneficial and harmful insects. In this method, unfamiliar/unknown predators are collected in plastic containers with brush from the field and brought to a place for study. Each predator is placed inside a plastic bottle together with parts of the plant and some known insect pests. Insects in the bottle are observed for certain time and determined whether the test insect is a pest (feeds on plant) or a predator (feeds on other insects). Pest: Defender ratio (P: D ratio): Identifying the number of pests and beneficial insects helps the farmers to make appropriate pest management decisions. Sweep net, visual counts etc. can be adopted to arrive at the numbers of pests and defenders. The P: D ratio can vary depending on the feeding potential of natural enemy as well as the type of pest. The natural enemies of potato insect pests can be divided into 3 categories; 1. parasitoids; 2. predators; and 3. pathogens. The general rule to be adopted for management decisions relying on the P: D ratio is 2: 1. However, some of the parasitoids and predators will be able to control more than 2 pests. Wherever specific P: D ratios are not found, it is safer to adopt the 2: 1, as P: D ratio. Whenever the P: D ratio is found to be favourable, there is no need for adoption of other management strategies. In cases where the P: D ratio is found to be unfavourable, the farmers can be advised to resort to inundative release of parasitoids/predators depending upon the type of pest. In addition to inundative release of parasitoids and predators, the usage of microbial biopesticides and biochemical biopesticides such as insect growth regulators, botanicals etc. can be relied upon before resorting to synthetic chemical pesticides. 6 AESA based IPM – Potato Decision taken based on the analysis of field situations Soil conditions : Weather conditions : Diseases types and severity : Weeds types and intensity : Rodent damage (if any) : No. of insect pests & damage severity : No. of natural enemies : P: D ratio : Model Agro-Ecosystem Analysis Chart Date: Village: Farmer: Decision making: Farmers become experts in crop management: Farmers have to make timely decisions about the management of their crops.

The past experience of the farmers should also be considered for decision making. However, as field conditions continue to change and new technologies become available, farmers need to continue improving their skills and knowledge. • Farmers are capable of improving farming practices by experimentation • Farmers can share their knowledge with other farmers AESA methodology: • Go to the field in groups (about 5 farmers per group). Walk across the field and choose 20 plants/acre randomly. Observe keenly each of these plants and record your observations: • Plant: Observe the plant length, number of leaves, crop stage, deficiency symptoms, no of pods etc. AESA based IPM – Potato7• Insect pests: Observe and count insect pests at different places on the plant. • Defenders (natural enemies): Observe and count parasitoids and predators. • Diseases: Observe leaves and stems and identify any visible disease symptoms and severity. • Rat: Count the number of plants affected by rats. • Weeds: Observe weeds in the field and their intensity. • Water: Observe the water situation of the field. • Weather: Observe the weather conditions. • While walking in the field, manually collect insects in plastic bags. Use a sweep net to collect additional insects. Collect plant parts with disease symptoms. • Find a shady place to sit as a group in a small circle for drawing and discussion. • If needed, kill the insects with some chloroform (if available) on a piece of cotton. • Each group will first identify the pests, defenders and diseases collected. • Each group will then analyze the field situation in detail and present their observations and analysis in a drawing (the AESA drawing). • Each drawing will show a plant representing the field situation. The weather conditions, water level, disease symptoms, etc. will be shown in the drawing. Pest insects will be drawn on one side. Defenders (beneficial insects) will be drawn on another side. Write the number next to each insect. Indicate the plant part where the pests and defenders were found.

What kind of change? • Is there any serious pest or disease outbreak? 8 AESA based IPM – Potato• What is the situation of the beneficial insects? • Is there a balance in the field between pests and defenders? • Were you able to identify all pests and diseases? • Do you think the crop is healthy? • What management practices are needed at this moment? • When will it be done? Who will do it? Make sure that responsibilities for all activities are being discussed. • Are you expecting any problems to emerge during the coming week such as congenial weather conditions for pest buildup? • What are the problems? How can we avoid it? How can we be prepared? • Summarize the actions to be taken. Advantages of AESA over ETL: One of the problems of the ETL is that it is based on parameters that are changing all the time, and that are often not known. The damage or losses caused by a certain density of insects cannot be predicted at all. In ETL the due recognition of the role of natural enemies in decreasing pest population is ignored. Farmers cannot base their decisions on just a simple count of pests. They will have to consider many other aspects of the crop (crop ecology, growth stage, natural enemies, weather condition, etc.) and their own economic and social situation before they can make the right crop management decisions. In ETL based IPM, natural enemies, plant compensation ability and abiotic factors are not considered. In AESA based IPM emphasis is given to natural enemies, plant compensation ability, abiotic factors and P: D ratio. AESA and farmer field school (FFS): AESA is a season-long training activity that takes place in the farmer field. It is season-long so that it covers all the different developmental stages of the crop and their related management practices. The process is always learner-centered, participatory and relying on an experiential learning approach and therefore it has become an integral part of FFS. Farmers can learn from AESA: • Identification of pests and their nature of damage • Identification of natural enemies • Management of pests • Water and nutrient management • Influence of weather factors on pest buildup • Role of natural enemies in pest management • Decision making process. AESA based IPM – Potato9B. Field scouting: AESA requires skill. So only the trained farmers can undertake this exercise.

Surveillance on pest occurrence in the field should commence soon after crop establishment and at weekly intervals thereafter. In each field, select five spots randomly. Select five random plants at each spot for recording counts of insects as per procedure finalized for individual insects. For insect pests: Aphid, jassid, whitefly and mite: Count and record the number of both nymphs and adults on five randomly selected leaves per plant. Thrips: Count and record the number of nymphs and adults of thrips present on five terminal leaves per plant (tapping method also can be used to count thrips). Leaf miner: Only the number of live mines on five randomly selected leaves per plant should be counted and recorded. Potato tuber moth, Spodoptera, Helicoverpa and cutworm: Total number of fruits, damaged fruits due to potato tuber moth, Helicoverpa, Spodoptera and cutworm and number of larvae on individual plants should be counted and recorded. For diseases: Whenever scouting, be aware that symptoms of plant disease problems may be caused by any biotic factors such as fungal, bacterial, viral pathogens or abiotic factors such as weather, fertilizers, nutrient deficiencies, pesticides and abiotic soil problems. In many cases, the cause of the symptom is not obvious. Close examination, and laboratory culture and analysis are required for proper diagnosis of the causal agent of disease. Generally fungal diseases cause the obvious symptoms with irregular growth, pattern &colour (except viruses), however abiotic problems cause regular, uniform symptoms. Pathogen presence (signs) on the symptoms can also be observed like fungal growth, bacterial ooze etc. Specific and characteristic symptoms of the important plant diseases are given in description of diseases section.FFS to teach AESA based IPM skills: 10 AESA based IPM – PotatoRoot sampling: Always check plants that appear unhealthy. If there are no obvious symptoms on plants, examine plants randomly and look for lesions or rots on roots and stems. Observe the signs of the causal organism (fungal growth or ooze). Always check plants that appear unhealthy. It is often necessary to wash the roots with water to examine them properly. If the roots are well developed, cut into them to examine the roots for internal infections (discolouration & signs). Count the total number of roots damaged/infested/infected due to rotshould be counted and incidence should be recorded. Leaf sampling: Examine all leaves and or leaflets on each plant for lesions and determine the amount area of leaf infection. Leaf diseases cause most damage during the seedling and flowering stages of plant growth. Observe for the symptoms and signs on the infected plant parts. Count the number of leaves (leaf area diameter)/ plant infected due to disease and incidence should be recorded. Stem and tuber sampling: Carefully examine the stems and tubers of plants for signs of fungal material or lesions.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING FOR PEST MANAGEMENT Ecological engineering for pest management has recently emerged as a paradigm for considering pest management approaches that rely on the use of cultural techniques to effect habitat manipulation and to enhance biological control. The cultural practices are informed by ecological knowledge rather than on high technology approaches such as synthetic pesticides and genetically engineered crops (Gurr et al. 2004 a,b). Natural enemies may require: 1. Food in the form of pollen", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Shelter such as overwintering sites, moderate microclimate etc. 3. Alternate hosts when primary hosts are not present. Ecological Engineering for Pest Management – Above Ground: • Raise the flowering plants / compatible cash crops along the field border by arranging shorter plants towards main crop and taller plants towards the border to attract natural enemies as well as to avoid immigrating pest population • Grow flowering plants on the internal bunds inside the field • Not to uproot weed plants those are growing naturally like Tridax procumbens, Ageratum sp, Alternanthera sp etc., which act as nectar source for natural enemies, • Not to apply broad spectrum chemical pesticides, when the P: D ratio is favourable. The plant compensation ability should also be considered before applying chemical pesticides. Ecological Engineering for Pest Management – Below Ground: • Crop rotations with leguminous plants which enhance nitrogen content. • Keep soils covered year-round with living vegetation and/or crop residue. • Add organic matter in the form of FYM, Vermicompost, crop residue which enhance below ground biodiversity. • Reduce tillage intensity so that hibernating natural enemies can be saved. • Apply balanced dose of fertilizers and nutrients. • Apply mycorrhiza and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) • Apply Trichoderma viride/ harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescen to seed/ seedling/ planting material, nursery, and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required). Due to enhancement of biodiversity by the flowering plants, parasitoids and predators (natural enemies) number also will increase due to availability of nectar, pollen, fruits, insects, etc. The major predators are a wide variety of spiders, ladybird beetles, long horned grasshoppers, Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, earwigs, etc. Ecological Engineering Plants Attractant plants Cowpea Carrot Dill 12 AESA based IPM – Potato Sorghum MaizeSunflower Alfalfa Repellent plants Border plants IntercropsOcimum spp. Maize CorianderBuckwheat Mustard Peppermint Bajra OnionFrench bean Parsley The flowering plants suggested under Ecological Engineering for pest management strategy are known as attractant plants to the natural enemies of the selected pests.

RODENT AND NON-RODENT VERTEBRATE PEST MANAGEMENT Management of rodents: • Plough the fields to demolish the rodent habitat and maintain weed free fields to reduce alternate source of food and habitat. • Practice burrow smoking using natural smoking materials in ANGRAU/ NIPHM burrow fumigator for 2-3 min. for each burrow. • Application of 0.005% bromadiolone in ready to use form (wax blocks) or loose bait in packets near rodent burrows. • Apply 2% zinc phosphide poison baits when the rodent infestation is very high. Practice pre-baiting incase of zinc phosphide poison baiting. • Don't apply zinc phosphide poisons more than one time in a crop season as rodents develop bait shyness to this poison. Management of porcupine and wild boars: • Fencing around crop fields with local available materials (bamboo etc.) RCC constructions, solar fencing, wood fencing, thread/wire fencing, trenching, bio-fencing etc. • Dig 2 ft wide and 1½ feet deep trench around the cropped area at a distance 1ft from the crops keeps away the wild boars from the field. • Plant four rows of safflower, castor plantation, thorny bushes while act as biological fenses. • Local practices like plantation of jatropha along borders of crop fields, application of bio pesticides/ repellents, at a distance of 10 ft, spraying of egg solution, arrangement of niwar soaked in kerosene (three rows), arrangement of coconut ropes soaked in mixture of sulphur+pig oil (castor oil based repellent) found effective in repelling the animal. (These animals are protected under wild life protection act, 1972). VI. INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE AND ITS MANAGEMENT Insecticide resistance: Resistance to insecticides may be defined as ‘a heritable change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species’ (IRAC). Cross-resistance occurs when resistance to one insecticide confers resistance to another insecticide, even where the insect has not been exposed to the latter product. Causes of resistance development: The causes and rate at which insecticide resistance develops depend on several factors, including the initial frequency of resistance alleles present in the population, how rapidly the insects reproduce, the insects’ level of resistance, the migration and host range of the insects, the insecticide's persistence and specificity, and the rate, timing and number of applications of insecticide made. For instance, insect pests that survive in large populations and breed quickly are at greater advantage of evolving insecticide, especially when insecticides are misused or over-used. General strategy for insecticide resistance management: The best strategy to avoid insecticide resistance is prevention and including insecticide resistance management tactics as part of a larger integrated pest management (IPM) approach. 1)Monitor pests: Monitor insect population development in fields to determine if and when control measures are warranted. Monitor and consider natural enemies when making control decisions. After treatment, continue monitoring to assess pest populations and their control. 2)Focus on AESA: Insecticides should be used only as a last resort when", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Apply biopesticides/chemical insecticides judiciously after observing unfavourable P: D ratio and when the pests are in most vulnerable life stage. Use application rates and intervals as per label claim. AESA based IPM – Potato233) Ecological engineering for pest management: Flowering plants that attract natural enemies as well as plants that repel pests can be grown as border/intercrop. 4)Take an integrated approach to managing pests: Use as many different control measures as possible viz., cultural, mechanical, physical, biological etc. Select insecticides with care and consider the impact on future pest populations and the environment. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides when a narrow-spectrum or more specific insecticide will work. More preference should be given to green labeled insecticides. 5)Mix and apply carefully: While applying insecticides care should be taken for proper application of insecticides in terms of dose, volume, timing, coverage, application techniques as per label claim. 6)Alternate different insecticide classes: Avoid the repeated use of the same insecticide, insecticides in the same chemical class, or insecticides in different classes with same mode of action and rotate/alternate insecticide classes and modes of action. 7)Preserve susceptible genes: Preserve susceptible individuals within the target population by providing unsprayed areas within treated fields, adjacent \"refuge\" fields, or habitat attractions within a treated field that facilitate immigration. These susceptible individuals may outcompete and interbreed with resistant individuals, diluting the resistant genes and therefore the impact of resistance. VII. NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES Nitrogen: The yellowing in nitrogen deficiency is uniform over the entire leaf including the veins. Recovery of deficient plants to applied nitrogen is immediate (days) and spectacular.Younger leaves turn darker green, older leaves remain yellow. Upward cupping of deficient when severs. Correction measure: Foliar application of 2% urea thrice at fortnightly interval or soil application of Nitrogen based on soil test recommendation. Phosphorus: The symptoms first develop on older leaves showing some necrotic spots and plants are dwarfed or stunted. Phosphorus deficient plants develop very slowly. Plants deve lop a distinct purpling of the stem, petiole and the under sides of the leaves. Plant remains stunted, darker than normal color. Lower leaf surface gray-green. Leaflets roll upward, severely if deficiency is severe. Correction measure: Soil application of recommended dose of phosphorous should be applied at the time of sowing or planting. Potassium: Since potassium is very mobile within the plant, symptoms only develop on young and full sized leaves in the case of extreme deficiency. Leaflets become rugose (crinkled). Some of the leaves show marginal necrosis (tip burn), and at a more advanced deficiency status show interveinal necrosis. As the deficiency progresses, most of the interveinal area becomes necrotic, the veins remain green and the leaves tend to curl and crinkle. Leaves take on a scorched appearance with black pigmentation and necrtic (dead tissue) edges. In contrast to nitrogen deficiency, chlorosis is irreversible in potassium deficiency, even if potassium is given to the plants. Correction measure: Foliar application of K2SO4 @1%. 24 AESA", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

This leaves show a general overall chlorosis. The veins and petioles show a very distinct reddish color. The yellowing is much more uniform over the entire plant including young leaves. The reddish color often found on the underside of the leaves. With advanced sulfur deficiency the leaves tend to become more erect and often twisted and brittle. Leaflet yellowing is uniform and general. Correction measure: Apply gypsum@ 100 Kg /acre in soil and use sulphur containing fertilizers e.g. SSP . Foliar spray of K2SO4 or CaSO4 @1% twice at fortnightly interval. Magnesium : The Mg-deficient leaves show advanced inter veinal chlorosis. Interveinal necrosis causes scorched look. In its advanced form, magnesium deficiency may superficially resemble potassium deficiency. The symptoms generally start with mottled chlorotic areas developing in the interveinal tissue. Symptoms appear first on young mature leaves. Correction measure: Foliar application of 0.2% MgSO4. Manganese: The leaves show a light interveinal chlorosis developed under a limited supply of Mn. The early stages of the chlorosis induced by manganese deficiency are somewhat similar to iron deficiency. As the stress increases, the leaves develop dark necrotic areas along the veins. Leave cup upward. Browing spotting ocurs on leaflets, especially along larger veins and mid-ribs. Correction measure: : Spray 0.2 % manganese sulphate 2-3 times at weekly intervals. Molybdenum: The leaves show some mottled spotting along with some inter veinal chlorosis. An early symptom for molybdenum deficiency is a general overall chlorosis, similar to the symptom for nitrogen deficiency but generally without the reddish coloration on the undersides of the leaves. Correction measure: Foliar spray of NaMO4 0.05% twice at weekly interval. Zinc: The leaves show interveinal necrosis. In the early stages of zinc deficiency the younger leaves become yellow and pitting develops in the interveinal upper surfaces of the mature leaves. As the deficiency progress these symptoms develop into an intense interveinal necrosis but the main veins remain green, as in the symptoms of recovering iron deficiency. Correction measure: Foliar spray of ZnSO4 @ 0.5%. AESA based IPM – Potato25Boron: These boron-deficient leaves show a light general chlorosis. Boron deficiency results in necrosis of meristematic tissues in the growing region, leading to loss of apical dominance and the development of a rosette condition. These deficiency symptoms are similar to those caused by calcium deficiency. The leaves are unusually brittle and tend to break easily. Also, there is often a wilting of the younger leaves even under an adequate water supply, pointing to a disruption of water transport caused by boron deficiency. Correction measure: Foliar spray of borax @ 0.2%. Calcium: The calcium-deficient leaves show necrosis around the base of the leaves. The very low mobility of calcium is a major factor determining the expression of calcium deficiency symptoms in plants. Symptoms show soft dead necrotic tissue at rapidly growing areas, which is generally related to poor translocation of calcium to the tissue rather than a low external supply of calcium. This ultimately results in the margins of the", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Plants under chronic calcium deficiency have a much greater tendency to wilt than non-stressed plants. Correction measure: Foliar spray of 2% Calcium sulphate twice at weekly intervals. Copper: The copper-deficient leaves are curled, and their petioles bend downward. Copper deficiency may be expressed as a light overall chlorosis along with the permanent loss of turgor in the young leaves. Recently matured leaves show netted, green veining with areas bleaching to a whitish gray. Some leaves develop sunken necrotic spots and have a tendency to bend downward. Correction measure: Foliar spray of 0.5% CuSO4 twice at fortnightly interval. Iron: The iron-deficient leaves show strong chlorosis at the base of the leaves with some green netting. The most common symptom for iron deficiency starts out as an interveinal chlorosis of the youngest leaves, evolves into an overall chlorosis, and ends as a totally bleached leaf. Because iron has a low mobility, iron deficiency symptoms appear first on the youngest leaves. Iron deficiency is strongly associated with calcareous soils, anaerobic conditions, and it is often induced by an excess of heavy metals.Growing point and young leaves become yellow or in extreme cases, white. Usually not accompanied by necrosis. Veins and leaflet ends remain green.

They damage the young and soft parts of plants, such as new leaves and shoots. Signs of damage are leaves not opening properly and being smaller in size. Severe infestation can cause shoots to wilt and dry out. • Indirect damage : Aphids have wings and can move from plant to plant spreading viral diseases, picked up from infected plants. Aphids secrete a sugary liquid that stimulates black sooty mold growth. It can cover the surface of leaves which affects the way they absorb sunlight.IX. DESCRIPTION OF INSECT, MITE AND NEMATODE PESTS 2) Leaf miner: Biology: It was introduced into India through Chrysanthemum cuttings. Egg: Eggs are laid inside leaves, they are very small and clear in color. Larvae hatch after about 2 - 3 days. Larva: Larvae remain inside leaves. They are very small and have no legs so cannot move from one leaf to another. The larval stage lasts around 6-12 days. Full grown larvae measure 3 mm. Pupa: These are formed in the ground or inside leaves. On potato plants, pupae usually fall to the ground. The pupal stage lasts around 14-16 days. Pupation takes place inside a thin loose mesh of silken cocoon. Adult: These are extremely small at 2-4 mm in length, black in color with two yellow spots on their backs, measuring 1.5 mm in length. They are most active in the morning from 7:00 to 9:00 and in the afternoon from 16:00 to 18:00. Adult flies produce an average of 166 eggs per female. They are attracted to the color yellow. The female fly punctures upper surface of leaf to lay eggs singly. The egg hatches in 4 days. Total life cycle takes 3 weeks. Generally it does not cause economic damage.

Adult stage, males leave the root and move through the soil to find females. • Females remain in the root, expanding and eventually rupturing it, remaining attached by the head and neck only. • After fertilization, the female produces 300 to 500 eggs which it retains within her body. The female dies with the root, but her skin hardens and turns brown while forming a protective cyst for the eggs. Damage symptoms: A. Root-knot nematode: • Swelling of roots – Nematodes damage and live in the roots of potato plants, causing them to swell. Swollen roots cannot function normally and affect growth of the plant above them. In hot conditions, plants damaged by nematodes will show wilting. • Irregular tuber shape – Tubers change shape and lumps appear on their surfaces.Heavily infested plants are stunted and exhibit early maturity. Reduction in size and number of tubers reduces the yield and warty 'pimple-like' outgrowths formed on tubers result in qualitative reduction. B. Cyst nematode: • Small patches of poorly growing plants appear in the field. Such plants show temporary wilting, stunting and premature yellowing symptoms. The size and number of tuber is reduced.

DESCRIPTION OF DISEASES 1) Bacterial wilt: Disease symptoms: • In addition to the potato, the pathogen also damages plants such as chili, tomato, tobacco and egg plant, as well as several species of weeds. • The symptoms of bacterial wilt infection can be seen on all parts of infected plants. • Infected plant begins to wilt, starting from the tips of the leaves or where the stems branch out, and then spreading to all parts of the plant. • Leaves become yellow at their bases, then the whole plant wilts and dies. When stems are cut a brown colored ring will be visible. • When a tuber is cut in half, black or brown rings will, however, be visible. If left for a while or squeezed, these rings will exude a thick white fluid. • A further symptom is fluid coming out of tuber eyes. This can be signified by soil sticking to tuber eyes when crops are harvested. Serious infection causes tubers to rot.

Favourable conditions: • Poor vigour of plants due to nutrient dificiency in late season • High humidity or persistent dew at 25 ºC • Moist weather with intermittent showers *For management refer to page number 17 3) Late blight: Disease symptoms: • This disease damages leaves, stems and tubers. Affected leaves appear blistered as if scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out. • When drying out, leaves turn brown or black in color. When infections are still active, spots appear on the underside of leaves blanketed in what looks like flour. • Affected stems begin to blacken from their tips, and eventually dry out. • Severe infections cause all foliage to rot, dry out and fall to the ground, stems to dry out and plants to die. • Affected tubers display dry brown-colored spots on their skins and flesh. This disease acts very quickly. If it is not controlled, infected plants will die within two or three days.Leaves showing disease symptoms 42 AESA based IPM – Potato Survival and spread: • The pathogen survives in plant debris in the soil. • It spreads through soil and infected seed tubers. Favourable condition: • High humidity • Low temperature and leaf wetness *For management refer to page numbers 17, 18 4) Early blight: Disease symptoms: • This is a common disease of potato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth and causes characteristic leaf spots and blight. • Normally the disease symptoms become apparent during tuber bulking stage and develop leading to the harvest. • The early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage. • Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area. • Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow.

The disease forms several types of cork-like lesions including surface . • Damaged tubers have rough, cracked skin, with scab-like spots. Severe infections leave potato skins covered with rough black welts. • Initial infections result in superficial reddish-brown spots on the surface of tubers. As the tubers grow, lesions expand, becoming corky and necrotic.

DESCRIPTION OF RODENT AND NON-RODENT VERTEBRATE PESTS Tuber damaged by lesser bandicoot1) Lesser bandicoot: Distribution and identification: Distributed throughout India and infests almost all crops. It is a robust rodent (200 to 300 g body weight) with a rounded head and a broad muzzle. Dorsum covered with grey-brownish rough hairs. Tail is naked, shorter than head and body. Breeds throughout the season and litter size 4-8 in normal conditions. Burrows are characterized by the presence of scooped soil at the entrance and mostly burrow openings are closed with soil. Damage symptoms: • During sowing, the sown seed material (tubers) will be dug out and damaged by the bandicoots • Mostly damage occurs at tuber formation/ harvesting stage. Bandicoots dig out the tubers by extensive burrowing; the damaged plants wither and dry up. • Often they hoard and damage the tubers. *For management refer to page number 22 2) Indian creased porcupine: 3) Wild boar: These animals are widely distributed in the country. Wild boars prefer grasslands, scanty bush jungles, forests and agriculture ecosystems. Damage symptoms: Wild boars dug the soil for the tubers during sowing and harvesting and cause extensive damage to the crop during these two stages.Distributed throughout the India. Problematic in especially in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, UP , Bihar and North Eastern region. Characterized by the presence of quills/ spines (modified fur). Tail is covered with short quills. Body weight more than 5-8 Kg. Damage symptoms : Cause severe damage to young and mature potato crops. They make very extensive burrow and mostly live in the rock cavities near hilly/hillock areas. *For management refer to page number 22 *For management refer to page number 22 AESA based IPM – Potato49XII. SAFETY MEASURES A. At the time of harvest: Most potatoes are ready for harvest 80 - 115 days after planting. If the potatoes are stored after harvest, the plant should be allowed to mature (die) before harvesting the potatoes. If a plant has not begun the maturation stage on its own, induction of maturation by killing the tops of the plant can be done. Harvesting of the tubers should be done approximately two to three weeks after the plant death. Shallow digging may damage the tubers and limit their storage life. Discard the seed piece--if it is still on the plant at the end of the season--and any green tubers. Harvesting can be done mechanically by cutting the plants at the soil surface with pruning shears or a knife. The top of the potato plant can be discarded.

Cover any exposed tubers with soil. The mature tuber has a tough skin that rubbing will not easily remove. A mature tuber will store much longer than an immature tuber. B. During post-harvest storage: After harvesting, potatoes are kept in heaps in cool places for another l0-15 days for drying and further curing of skin. Maintaining heaps 3-4 metre long, wide at the base and about 1 metre wide at the top are the best. In hills the harvested potatoes are spread in well-ventilated rooms for drying. Before grading, all the cut, damaged and rotted tubers are removed. The tubers are then graded and packed in gunny bags according to sizes preferably in 4 sizes, e.g. small (less than 25g), medium (25-50g), large (50-75g) and extra large (above 75g). After grading potatoes meant for use as seed during the next year are treated with 3% boric acid solution for 30 minutes for protecting against soil-borne pathogens, e.g. black scurf, common scab, etc. before storing in bags. Keep potatoes in a dark, well-ventilated cool place (60 - 65° F) for t 10 to 14 days after harvest to allow cuts and bruises to heal. They should be moved to a final storage location with a high relative humidity, good aeration, and colder temperature (38 - 40° F). The tubers may sprout at warmer temperatures. So apply chlorpropham 50% HN as antisprouting agent for stocked potatoes under cold storage condition @ 36-40 ml/MT. Be sure to remove any damaged or rotten potatoes prior to placing the crop in long term storage as these will produce a nasty smell and greatly shorten the storage life of the rest of the crop. If you wash the tubers, allow them to dry thoroughly before storing. Under proper conditions, potatoes can be stored for three to six months or more. 50 AESA based IPM – PotatoXIII. DO’S AND DON’TS IN IPM S.No. Do’s Don’ts 1. Deep ploughing is to be doneon bright sunny days during the months of May and June. The field should be kept exposed to sun light at least for 2-3 weeks Do not plant or irrigate the field after ploughing, at least for 2-3 weeks, to allow desiccation of weed’s bulbs and/or rhizomes of perennial weeds 2. Adopt crop rotation Avoid growing monocropping 3. Grow only recommended varieties Do not grow varieties not suitable for the season or the region 4. Sow tubers early in the season Avoid late plantingas this may lead to reduced yields and incidence of white grubs and diseases 5. Always treat the seed tubers with approved biopesticides/ chemicals for the control of seed borne diseases/pestsDo not use seed tubers without seed treatment with biopesticides/chemicals 6.

{"id": "National Horticulture Board (India) — Potato Disease Bulletins_0", "source_id": "National Horticulture Board (India) — Potato Disease Bulletins", "title": "National Horticulture Board (India) — Potato Disease Bulletins.pdf", "text": "Potato Pests Aphids (Myzus persica e, Aphis gossyp i, Aphis fabae ): There are several kinds of aphids that feed on potato plants. Aphids transmit a virus disease and cause severe damage to the plant by sucking the juice from leaves and young stems. The plants may be stunted, with the leaves tightly curled and rolled when the attack is severe. thControl: Aphids are controlled by adjusting the planting dated upto 15 October in north western th thplains, 25 October in Central plains and upto 5 November in North eastern plains. In the Plains, aphids are controlled by application of Phorate 10 G (1.5kg a.i./ha) followed by spraying with Dimethoate 30 EC (0.03%). The spraying should be repeated every week till the insect is completely controlled. Cut Worms (Agrotis ipsilon and Agrotis segetum ): The caterpillars cause crop damage. They feed at night on young shoots or under ground tubers. In the early stages of if crop, the caterpillars cut the stem of the young plants near the ground and feed on the shoots and leaves. After tuber formation, they bore and nibble into the tubers affecting both tuber yield and market value.Control: Hot weather ploughing in plains and autumn ploughing in hills reduce the population of immature stages. A number of birds, feed on insects that get exposed upon ploughing. Spraying insecticides like Chlorpyrifos 20EC (2.5 litres/ha) and drenching the ridges on noticing the cutworms controls the pest. Mites (Polyphagotarsonemus latus ): The peak activity of mites occurs during August-September and mid October- mid December. Both adults and nymphs damage the crop by foliage feeding. Mite attack starts from the top potato leaves showing downward curling. In the early stages of infestation, the lower side of leaves appears 'oily'. Gradually these symptoms can be seen on the entire plant. The infested leaves become short and leathery in appearance with characteristic copper colour deposits on lower side. Under severe mite attack, the infested leaves dry up and wither away resulting into death of the plant. Control: The mite infestation on potato crop can be avoided by delayed planting towards mid October in Indo-Gangetic plains. Frequent spraying with Dicofol 18.5 EC or Quinalphos 25 EC @ 2.0 litres/ha controls the pest. The first application should be done on appearance of the pest and repeated at 7 to 10 days interval depending on the persistence of mite infestation. Rootknot Nematode (Meloidogynae arenaria and M. incognita ): Small galls or knots are formed on potato roots but they often go unnoticed. Heavily infested plants are stunted and exhibit early maturity. Reduction in size and number of tubers reduces the yield and warty 'pimple-like' outgrowths formed on tubers result in qualitative reduction.Control: Avoiding use of seeds from infested areas, deep ploughing and drying of soil in summer months facilitate drying of infective larva, burning of trash and following a two year rotational sequence of' maize-wheat-potato-wheat reduces the root-knot damage significantly . Late Panting of autumn crop and early planting of spring crop in North-Western", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}

Application of Carbofuran (Furadan 3G) @ 3 kg a.i./ha is recommended for control of nematodes. The pesticide is applied in two split doses, first at planting and second during earthing up. Potato Cyst Nematode (Globodera pallida ): Small patches of poorly growing plants appear in the field. Such plants show temporary wilting, stunting and premature yellowing symptoms. The size and number of tuber is reduced. Small mustard seed size yellow or white female nematodes are seen sticking to the roots. Control: Growing non-host crops like radish, garlic, beet and turnip brings down the cyst population. Application of Carbofuran 3G (2 kg a.i./ha) at the time of planting reduces the nematode population. White Grubs (Lachnosterna longipennis and L. coracea ): The grubs initially feed on rootlets/roots and then on tubers. The first stage grubs feed on live roots while the second and third instar grubs make large, shallow and circular holes in the tuber and render them unfit for marketing. Control: A majority of beetles (white grub adults) found in Western Himalayas are attracted to the light source hence electric or petromax light traps may be operated for mass-collection. Wild shrubs and other hosts of beetles growing in/around the potato fields should be removed. Repeated ploughing before monsoon (April-May) exposes the grubs and pupae. They may be hand- collected and destroyed. Flooding of the fields, for 7-10 days, adopting suitable crop rotations and applying well rotten FYM helps in controlling the pest. Applying Phorate 10G or Carbofuran 3G @ 2.5- 3.0 kg a.i. /ha in furrows at planting or near plants base during earthing time is more effective. Potato T ubermoth (Phthorimaea operculella ): Potato tubermoth (PTM) larvae mine the younger leaves and feeds on the tubers. Larvae penetrate the leaves and feed within leaf veins or stems of the plant and on tubers in storage by depositing the eggs near the eye buds, causing irregular galleries and 'tunnels' deep inside the tuber. Control: An integrated approach is helpful in reducing PTM population in the field and stores. Regular 3 monitoring of PTM adult males with sex pheromone baited water traps (4 traps/100 m ) in field and storage is helpful. Collection of left over tubers, use of uninfested seed tubers, deep planting, frequent irrigation wherever possible, covering the exposed tubers in the field with soil and storage of healthy tubers in moth proof structures are helpful. Spraying Monocrotophos 40 EC (1.5 litre in 1000 litres of water) on 30 day old crop is effective in controlling the pest. The same may be repeated two weeks before harvesting. Use of bioagents, viz. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and Granulosis virus (GV) is advocated for PTM control in the stores.", "diseases": NaN, "region": NaN, "action_type": "other"}
